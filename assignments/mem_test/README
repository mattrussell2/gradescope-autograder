This is intended to test the max_ram and kill_limit features of the autograder. 

The 'solution' code should fail/pass as indicated in the description strings for the tests.
To run it and test, run `build_ref_output` in this directory.  If that command fails, read the 
README.md in the repo's root directory for more info.
