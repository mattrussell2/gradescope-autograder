This is a sanity-check of tests. 
There is really no 'solution' as-such, it's just a set of .cpp tests. 

The tests each are supposed to pass/fail as indicated. 

Running build_ref_output will run the tests and print the result summary.

Run build_ref_output -k to see the results/ folder with the relevant info.
