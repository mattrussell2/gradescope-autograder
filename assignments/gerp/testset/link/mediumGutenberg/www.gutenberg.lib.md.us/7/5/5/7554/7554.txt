that I did so too

Thence by coach, with a mad coachman,
that drove like mad

Thence to Mrs. Martin's, and did what I
would with her

There is no passing but by coach in the
streets, and hardly that

There eat and drank, and had my
pleasure of her twice

There did 'tout ce que je voudrais
avec' her

There setting a poor man to keep my
place

There is no man almost in the City
cares a turd for him

There being ten hanged, drawn, and
quartered

These young Lords are not fit to do any
service abroad

These Lords are hard to be trusted

They were so false spelt that I was
ashamed of them

They want where to set their feet, to
begin to do any thing

This day churched, her month of
childbed being out

This absence makes us a little strange
instead of more fond

This week made a vow to myself to drink
no wine this week

This day I began to put on buckles to
my shoes

This unhappinesse of ours do give them
heart

This kind of prophane, mad
entertainment they give themselves

Those absent from prayers were to pay a
forfeit

Those bred in the North among the
colliers are good for labour

Though he knows, if he be not a fool,
that I love him not

Thus it was my chance to see the King
beheaded at White Hall

Tied our men back to back, and thrown
them all into the sea

To Mr. Holliard's in the morning,
thinking to be let blood

To be enjoyed while we are young and
capable of these joys

To see Major-general Harrison hanged,
drawn; and quartered

To the Swan and drank our morning draft

To see the bride put to bed

Too much of it will make her know her
force too much

Took physique, and it did work very
well

Tory--The term was not used politically
until about 1679

Tried the effect of my silence and not
provoking her

Trouble, and more money, to every
Watch, to them to drink

Troubled me, to see the confidence of
the vice of the age

Two shops in three, if not more,
generally shut up

Uncertainty of all history

Uncertainty of beauty

Unless my too-much addiction to
pleasure undo me

Unquiet which her ripping up of old
faults will give me

Up, leaving my wife in bed, being sick
of her months

Up, finding our beds good, but lousy;
which made us merry

Up and took physique, but such as to go
abroad with

Upon a very small occasion had a
difference again broke out

Venison-pasty that we have for supper
to-night to the cook's

Very angry we were, but quickly friends
again

Very great tax; but yet I do think it
is so perplexed

Vexed at my wife's neglect in leaving
of her scarf

Vexed me, but I made no matter of it,
but vexed to myself

Vices of the Court, and how the pox is
so common there

Voyage to Newcastle for coles

Waked this morning between four and
five by my blackbird

Was kissing my wife, which I did not
like

We are to go to law never to revenge,
but only to repayre

We had a good surloyne of rost beefe

Weary of it; but it will please the
citizens
Weather being very wet and hot to keep
meat in.

What way a man could devise to lose so
much in so little time

What I said would not hold water

What I had writ foule in short hand

What they all, through profit or fear,
did promise

What a sorry dispatch these great
persons give to business

What is there more to be had of a woman
than the possessing her

Where money is free, there is great
plenty

Where I find the worst very good

Where a piece of the Cross is

Where a trade hath once been and do
decay, it never recovers

Where I expect most I find least
satisfaction

Wherein every party has laboured to
cheat another

Which he left him in the lurch

Which I did give him some hope of,
though I never intend it

Whip this child till the blood come, if
it were my child!

Whip a boy at each place they stop at
in their procession

Who is the most, and promises the
least, of any man

Who we found ill still, but he do make
very much of it

Who must except against every thing and
remedy nothing

Whose red nose makes me ashamed to be

Wise man's not being wise at all times

Wise men do prepare to remove abroad

With a shower of hail as big as walnuts

Wonders that she cannot be as good

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
