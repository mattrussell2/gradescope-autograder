QUOTES AND IMAGES:  MEMOIRS OF CARDINAL DE RETZ




THE MEMOIRS OF CARDINAL DE RETZ


By Cardinal de Retz





Always judged of actions by men, and
never men by their actions

Always to sacrifice the little affairs
to the greater

Arms which are not tempered by laws
quickly become anarchy

Associating patience with activity

Assurrance often supplies the room of
good sense

Blindness that make authority to
consist only in force

Bounty, which, though very often
secret, had the louder echo

Buckingham had been in love with three
Queens

By the means of a hundred pistoles
down, and vast promises

Civil war as not powerful enough to
conclude a peace

Civil war is one of those complicated
diseases

Clergy always great examples of slavish
servitude

Confounded the most weighty with the
most trifling

Contempt--the most dangerous disease of
any State

Dangerous to refuse presents from one's
superiors

Distinguished between bad and worse,
good and better

Fading flowers, which are fragrant
to-day and offensive tomorrow

False glory and false modesty

Fool in adversity and a knave in
prosperity

Fools yield only when they cannot help
it

Good news should be employed in
providing against bad

He weighed everything, but fixed on
nothing

He knew how to put a good gloss upon
his failings

He had not a long view of what was
beyond his reach

Help to blind the rest of mankind, and
they even become blinder

His ideas were infinitely above his
capacity

His wit was far inferior to his courage

Impossible for her to live without
being in love with somebody

Inconvenience of popularity

Insinuation is of more service than
that of persuasion

Is there a greater in the world than
heading a party?

Kinds of fear only to be removed by
higher degrees of terror

Laws without the protection of arms
sink into contempt

Man that supposed everybody had a back
door

Maxims showed not great regard for
virtue

Mazarin: embezzling some nine millions
of the public money

Men of irresolution are apt to catch at
all overtures

More ambitious than was consistent with
morality

My utmost to save other souls, though I
took no care of my own

Need of caution in what we say to our
friends

Neither capable of governing nor being
governed

Never had woman more contempt for
scruples and ceremonies

Nothing is so subject to delusion as
piety

Oftener deceived by distrusting than by
being overcredulous

One piece of bad news seldom comes
singly

Only way to acquire them is to show
that we do not value them

Passed for the author of events of
which I was only the prophet

Poverty so well became him

Power commonly keeps above ridicule

Pretended to a great deal more wit than
came to his share

Queen was adored much more for her
troubles than for her merit

She had nothing but beauty, which cloys
when it comes alone

So indiscreet as to boast of his
successful amours

Strongest may safely promise to the
weaker what he thinks fit

The subdivision of parties is generally
the ruin of all

The wisest fool he ever saw in his life

Those who carry more sail than ballast

Thought he always stood in need of
apologies

Transitory honour is mere smoke

Treated him as she did her petticoat

Useful man in a faction because of his
wonderful complacency

Vanity to love to be esteemed the first
author of things

Verily believed he was really the man
which he affected to be

Virtue for a man to confess a fault
than not to commit one

We are far more moved at the hearing of
old stories

Weakening and changing the laws of the
land

Who imagine the head of a party to be
their master

Whose vivacity supplied the want of
judgment

Wisdom in affairs of moment is nothing
without courage

With a design to do good, he did evil

Yet he gave more than he promised

You must know that, with us Princes,
words go for nothing

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
