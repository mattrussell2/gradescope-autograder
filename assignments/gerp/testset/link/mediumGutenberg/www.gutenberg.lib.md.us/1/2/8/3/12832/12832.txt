DEDICATION.

TO MY MOTHER ON HER FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY.


  Half of a century's gladness
    And half of a century's tears,
  Lost in the mighty silence
    Of the past and vanished years!

  Oh, what a sea of memories
    Surge back from the time gone by--
  The waters of Life's river;
    How many a smile or sigh--

  Has made them dance and sparkle;
    Or, storm-tossed as they ran,
  Adown the course of Being,
    Since the current first began!

  How many a note of gladness
    Has the music of their flow,
  Brought to the hearts of others
    To lighten their load of woe!

  How often, too, has Duty
    Claimed its sacrifice of pain?
  How many hours of sorrow
    Have been for another's gain?

  No mind can weigh or measure,
    The light that a woman's love
  Casts on Life's darkened pathways,
    Save that of the God above.

  From out the time that's vanished
    A message of Peace is borne.
  A future glad in Promise,
  Like a sunshine-laden morn--

  Smiles welcome now and beckons
    To a new and brighter day.
  The years to come are gladder
    Than those that have passed away.




PREFACE.


It is the custom of some authors to preface their earlier works with
excuses for sending their "little volume out into the world," and to
bespeak in its behalf the leniency of both critic and reader. I have
no such apologies, however, to make for this work. I have confidence
in its success and it will win or lose, according to its merits, no
matter what I say.

"Said The Observer" represents stray ideas, gathered here and there
and everywhere, which I have decked out in gay habiliments of
Fancy and embellished with such wit as I possess. Do not take them
seriously, I pray you, for their aim is to amuse. Do not feel offended
if some pet corn is trod upon, for it is all in fun and no malice is
intended.

Most of the sketches have already appeared in the Los Angeles
_Herald_ and the reader may detect in some a touch of localism, as
for instance, in "The Essentials of Greatness," which refers casually
to the passing of Senator Stephen M. White. "Steve White," as he
was affectionately dubbed by those who knew him, was a great man in
California, though, perhaps, his fame as an orator and statesman may
not have penetrated far beyond the borders of the Golden State. In two
other sketches references are made to Li Hung Chang. Both were written
prior to the death of the distinguished Oriental diplomat, and I
have chosen to explain seeming anachronisms, rather than change my
narrative to conform with later events.

[Illustration: INFLUENCE OF THE PIPE.]


"I see, by a recent paper," said the Observer, as he lit another cigar
and resettled himself in his chair, "that a Chicago physician and a
lot of fool women, who are evidently jealous of Carrie Nation, are
about to start an active crusade against the 'Smoke Nuisance.' This
is ambiguous enough to warrant the supposition that their object is
the compulsory introduction of some patented device for clearing the
atmosphere of Pittsburg and other manufacturing towns, but their real
aim is to discourage the use of tobacco. Now, of all the human pests
which afflict the long-suffering public, the anti-smoke agitator
is about the worst. Why, man alive! what would become of the human
race without tobacco? It is the grease which lubricates the Wheel
of Evolution. Since the time of Sir Walter Raleigh civilization
has advanced more rapidly by one hundred per cent. Nearly all great
inventors, artists and writers owe their inspiration to the pipe.

"A very successful newspaper man whom I know has four different pipes
and each serves a special purpose. When he wants to write a humorous
article, he says to his wife, 'Where is my funny pipe?' and she hands
him a long-handled affair with a weichsel-wood bowl and a cherry stem
that has a kind of rakish, good-natured curve to it. Then he sits
down and grinds out copy that will make an Englishman laugh at first
sight. A big, dumpy brier, with a shorter stem and a celluloid end, is
responsible for general descriptive work, sporting news, etc., while
a trim little meerschaum with a carved bowl engenders excellent
criticisms of music and drama. Occasionally, too, this bright
fellow, who does considerable work on the editorial page, gets into
a newspaper controversy. Then he pulls from his pocket a short
'bull-dog' with a horn tip, whose massive, square-jawed bowl and
ferocious short-curved stem breathe forth aggressiveness, and, jamming
it full of 'plug cut,' he writes one of those satirical, sledge-hammer
roasts which make him feared by his opponents.

"One night he was detailed to write up a show at one of the leading
theatres. The play was 'East Lynne,' which, as a tear-producer, ranks
away up and was presented by a first-class company. When the critic
reached home he was feeling pretty sad, so he looked around for his
meerschaum. His wife had been cleaning house that day and he couldn't
find any pipe but the long one. What was the result? Why, he wrote
such a humorous description of the play that everybody thought 'East
Lynne' was a farce comedy and, when the performance closed on the
following night, two-thirds of the audience wanted their money back.

"His worst crack, though, was when a man of great local prominence,
who stood high with the people, died and it fell to G.'s lot to
describe the funeral ceremonies and eulogize the deceased. G.'s
mother-in-law had just arrived and the poor fellow was so badly
rattled that he got hold of the 'bull-dog' instead of the brier and
made the Hon. G. out the grandest rascal who had ever preyed upon the
vitals of a law-abiding community. The only thing that saved his neck
this time was the fact that it all turned out to be true and his paper
got the credit of a 'scoop.' After that he had a little case made to
hold all four of his pipes, with a strap to go around his neck--and I
guess he sleeps with it now.

"They say that Guttenberg conceived the notion of the printing press
while taking an after-dinner smoke; that Stephenson's ideas of steam
locomotion came to him through the curling wreaths of his favorite
Virginia; and that Morse figured out the telegraph with a pipe in
his mouth. I never could corroborate these statements, though I don't
doubt them a bit. But, be that as it may, the man, woman or child who
tries to deprive us of the solace and inspiration of tobacco, is like
the goat that tried to butt a train off the track. He is not only
trifling with one of the greatest factors in civilization, but he is
toying with a lost cause."

OUR FRIEND THE MURDERER.


"No, I don't believe in capital punishment," said the Observer, as he
rose from the barber's chair and adjusted his collar before the glass.
"It's less expensive for the government than to board a man for life,
and it satisfies the popular idea of justice, but I doubt very much
its efficiency in the suppression of crime.

"Take the average murderer, for instance. He seems to look forward
to his execution with happy anticipation. He may have been a hopeless
dyspeptic who killed his wife in an agony of indigestion, following
a repast of hot biscuits and flannel cakes, such as 'mother used to
make,' but as the hour of death approaches, he regains his appetite,
and, just before the solemn moment, partakes of a hearty breakfast.
His whole life may have been a record of flagrant cowardice, yet he
walks steadily to the scaffold and dies 'like a man'; he may have
been illiterate to a degree, yet in the very shadow of the gallows
he writes a statement for publication the depth and power of which
astonishes the world. From the sentence to the finish, the murderer's
life is one bed of roses. Every pretty girl who visits the prison
brings him flowers and sweets, and begs eagerly for his autograph;
great authors write books about him; great lawyers draw up petitions
from notable men and women asking for his pardon, and the governor's
secretary works night and day, declining their requests, writing
special permits and "standing off" tearful relatives, friends and
sweethearts, who spring up as if by magic to plead his cause.

"No other man gets half the flattering attention that is given the
condemned; no one else is given half the chance to make a glorious
finish. By some occult influence his faults are utterly effaced and
every latent talent is developed to a point of absolute perfection.
When this 'ne plus ultra' is reached, a quick curtain is dropped over
his career, and he lives in the memory of countless thousands as a
martyred hero of the most splendid moral and mental attainments.

"Who would not sacrifice life for such a climax? Many men have said to
Fame and Wisdom, 'Let me look upon your face and die'; many have come
to view their Gorgon features and cheerfully paid the price, and still
more have perished miserably on the way.

"Now, what is the murderer's sacrifice compared to these? He is
carefully attended, afforded every luxury, and at last, is whisked
away into eternity, quickly, and, as far as possible, painlessly, with
a grand opera and limelight effect.

"We have learned many things from Mongolia; gunpowder, the printing
press and many other great discoveries have been traced back to
Celestial origin. Let us, then, adopt her method of dealing with
troublesome subjects. A 'harikari' sentence saves the nation much
trouble and expense. A coroner's verdict of 'suicide by request,' is
much more simple, and just as good as a lengthy criminal prosecution,
besides affording the transgressor a choice of weapons. He may prefer
a strychnine sandwich to the rope, or an unobtrusive blow-out-the-gas
transition to the electric chair; he may choose to loiter carelessly
in the path of a metropolitan trolley car; to caress the rear
elevation of an army mule, or insist upon reading a spring poem to
an athletic and busy editor. Many persons are particular upon these
subjects and, if the individual liberty, which is the watchword of
our nation, is to be preserved, some license should be allowed even a
felon under such conditions.

"If we really wish to decrease and discourage vice, however, let us
go about it in a logical manner and hold up a terrible example to
those premeditating crime. The prisoner should be visited by none but
religious advisers of every denomination, except on certain days when
free admittance should be granted to sketch artists, camera fiends,
elocutionists and young authors. All newspaper articles relating to
his case should be carefully suppressed; no reading matter furnished
him except dialect stories, and amateur photographs, taken by
visitors, should be hung upon the wall. Between times the prisoner
might be employed in washing dishes for a cooking school and testing
the products of pupils. After two months of unremitting toil,
according to this itinerary, he might be safely liberated, if life
remained, and it is safe to say that his experience, when related to
associates, would have a more deterrent effect upon the 'profesh' than
several kinds of death penalties could hope to produce."




SCIENCE AND WEATHER.


"Science," said the Observer, "is a great thing and applicable to
almost every line of endeavor. You can kill people in a scientific
manner--witness the late Madame Borgia and others. You can shoe a
horse scientifically, beg scientifically or hypnotize a squalling
infant into innocuous quietude by the aid of science. Marconi has
signalled across the ocean; Santos-Dumont has navigated the air and
Austria has proven her neutrality in the Spanish-American war by
scientific means. But there is one thing which Science cannot tackle
with any degree of success, and that is the weather problem.

"The gift of weather prophecy goes with rheumatism and not with
government appointment. The barometer and the anemometer are not in it
with a touch of gout, a sailor's superstitions or a farmer's instinct,
and, until the Department of Agriculture realizes this, the weather
forecast will have no practical value except as an interesting bit of
fiction.

"I once heard of a man who was 'salivated' in a quicksilver mine,
and who, as a result, turned into a living barometer. If his head was
clear and his feet were heavy, it was a sure sign of rain in Summer or
frost in Winter. If, on the contrary, he seemed depressed mentally and
yearned for exercise, a rise in temperature and fair weather were in
order. He amassed a large fortune in making weather bets, but one day
when the thermometer was down below zero, he stepped on a tack and
all the mercury ran out of his heel. After that he lost all his money
betting with a neighbor who had a rheumatic left joint, and died of
grief in abject poverty.

"The only way by which the government may hope to secure competent
weather prognostigators is in the establishment of regular training
schools for its prophets. The candidate should be examined as to
fitness, just as the applicant for a West Point cadetship. He
should possess inherited tendencies toward rheumatism as a primary
qualification. Then, after serving three years before the mast and
putting in an equal period of active labor on a farm, he would be able
to turn out correct forecasts with no other apparatus than a set of
signal flags, a typewriter and a hektograph.

"It wouldn't be scientific," concluded the Observer, reflectively,
"because he couldn't explain his deductions on a basis of dynamic
pressure, electrical disturbances, or velocity of air currents. But
it would be a safe tip for the city man to get out his umbrella,
mackintosh and overshoes and for the farmer to cover up his hay, if
the rain flag were seen to float on the weather pole."

Fame."]

THE ESSENTIALS OF GREATNESS.


"Oh yes! Steve White was a great man," said the Observer, as he chalked
his cue and reflectively gazed at the balls, "but he was born in that
class. If he hadn't been, Stephen Mallory White would probably have
cut no greater figure in the world than any other man.

"Did you ever hear of a man who wasn't born in some country village,
'of poor but honest parents,' amounting to a row of pins? Not on your
life! It's the true and only essential of greatness. Yes, there are
lots of fellows fixed that way who don't make their mark, but that's
because they don't try.

"Everybody knows how Carnegie got his start; didn't Lincoln use to
chop wood for a living, and Garfield drive a canal boat team? Wasn't
Gould a messenger boy, and General Miles a private? It's a 'cinch,'
a 'kismet.' Fate has posted a great big placard over the door to Fame
and it says, 'None But Impecunious Young Countrymen Need Apply.'

"That is why I always thought reincarnation was a good scheme. The
Theosophists say that every soul must pass through a certain number of
experiences, before it can attain perfection. Now, here's a chance for
some unfortunate scion of wealth or nobility, who has lived a useless
and uneventful life, and wants to do something for his country.

"He can go to some secluded hamlet, inquire as to the probable date
of the next birth in the neighborhood, and, when things are in shape,
he can blow out the gas some night and wake up the next morning as a
new-born babe, with all the elements of greatness strong upon him.

"When this fact becomes generally known, people will donate their
funds to charitable institutions and move to the country to raise
future presidents, senators and merchant princes; there will be an
epidemic of suicide among the idle rich, and the birth-rate of our
rural districts will increase a hundredfold; the population of cities
will be sadly decimated; waste lands will be cleared and cultivated,
as if by magic, and, a generation hence, there will come forth from
the agricultural regions a host of young toilers with Destiny's
diploma for future greatness in their pockets."

The Observer was so wrapped up in his prophecy that he missed his shot
by fully half an inch and put the wrong end of his cigar in his mouth.
After carefully wiping the ashes out of his teeth and kicking the
proprietor's cat, he resumed:

"I rather got off the subject, and don't want you to put me down
as endorsing reincarnation, either, but when I hear a lot of folks
talking about what a great man So-and-So was; how he had to get up
before daylight to chop wood and feed the stock, in order to get to
school on time, I say to myself, 'What Tommyrot! As if Providence
didn't have it all fixed for him.'"




HORSE SENSE


"In some ways the average man hasn't the sense of the average
horse," said the Observer, taking a shot at the cuspidor and looking
thoroughly disgusted. "Horse sense is a brand of intelligence
immeasurably above that displayed by human beings under certain
conditions. No, I'm not suffering from dyspepsia or gout--I've simply
been watching people as they try to pass each other in halls and
doorways, and on the street. It's enough to make a man ashamed that he
was born a 'Lord of creation.'

"The average horse doesn't need to be guided when he sees another
horse coming the other way. He swerves to the right, as naturally
as a bull-dog chases a tramp. What does the average man do when he
suddenly meets another coming hurriedly in an opposite direction? He
places himself squarely in front of him and then begins a series of
side-steps, first to one side and then the other, in exact accordance
with those of the man he is trying to pass, like the mirror pantomime
in Hanlon's Fantasma. Finally, both come to a standstill, facing each
other, and one tries to execute a quick flank movement to the left.
Just at this moment the other suddenly remembers that he would have
avoided all this tomfoolery if he had only kept to the right, and
tries to make good on this hypothesis. The result is that they bump
into each other violently and begin side-stepping again. After another
round or two of Terpsichorean gymnastics one of them breaks through
the other's guard and escapes and each continues on his belated way,
thinking what an infernal idiot the other is.

[Illustration: "Oof!"]

"I have known men who gained international renown for their
strategy and 'sang froid' on the battlefield; men whose calmness
and deliberation have averted many a financial crisis and men whose
marvelous executive capacity and keen insight into human affairs have
won them great fortunes. I have seen these same men trying to pass
other pedestrians in a narrow hallway and act in a way which would
make a lunatic ashamed of himself.

"A drummer, who travels for a large Eastern jobbing concern, was once
entering the establishment of a firm which always bought heavily
from his house. One of the proprietors was just going out. They came
together in the doorway, and, before they could pass each other, a
rival salesman slipped by and sold the other partner a large bill of
goods.

"Congress ought to pass an appropriation for the purpose of teaching
people how to pass each other. If the surplus energy and brainwork
consumed in this task under present methods were applied to some more
useful purpose, a great reform movement would have been inaugurated."




THE MANNISH WOMAN.


"I don't want to achieve a reputation as a 'knocker,'" said the
Observer, knitting his brow thoughtfully, "but, I nevertheless, aver
and maintain that the national evil of this great land is the mannish
woman.

"No, I don't mean the woman who can earn a living in some professional
pursuit that has hitherto been monopolized by men. Why, with our male
milliners, dressmakers, cooks, and what not, she has been driven to it
by man himself. Even the servant girl has become a thing of the past,
and the 'help' of the present day wears trousers,--not metaphorically,
as his female predecessor was wont to do--but literally. However, I'm
not going to discuss the servant-girl question. That is an old story
and a painful one--almost as painful as the mannish woman.

"This fearful and wonderful product of American progressiveness--this
worst type of monomaniac (man-o-maniac, one might more appropriately
term her) is driving men to drink. The mother-in-law is a thing of
beauty and a joy forever, compared to the mannish woman; the female
book-agent takes on new lustre and even the poetess is a desirable
companion beside her. The mannish woman wears a coat and vest and--no,
she doesn't wear trousers, because she doesn't dare, but a vertical
strip of braid down the middle of her skirt suggests the effect. From
a distance you couldn't distinguish between her and a man to save your
life, for her hat, shirt-bosom, collar and tie are the real thing.
She has pockets in her skirt, one on each side, and, sometimes at
the club, she puts her hands in them and, with arms akimbo, admires
herself in the glass. At the club also she does other things to
show how independent she is. She slaps her friend on the back with
a 'Hello, Gertie. How's tricks?' and orders a glass of soda-lemonade
with a cherry in it. She wouldn't take a man's arm for the world,
which is perhaps fortunate, for she seldom gets a chance. But she
likes to talk to a man about the races and exhibit her knowledge of
baseball slang.

"A friend of mine has an elderly sister who is a mannish woman.
Contrary to the popular belief, she never borrows his neckties or
collars, but perhaps this may be accounted for by the fact that Fred
is rather stout in the neck and seldom wears a tie. She got him to tie
a four-in-hand for her one day. Fred used to be a sea-captain in his
early days and, although he could make all kinds of splices with a
rope, he had never tackled a four-in-hand. He was game, however, and,
after a hard tussle, accomplished what is known in nautical parlance
as a 'clove hitch.' Fred's sister wore it night and day for a week and
then cut it off with a pair of scissors.

"Fred had another experience some time after this which nearly proved
serious. His sister was on the reception committee for a club function
one evening and asked her brother's advice in regard to mixing punch.
Fred is an obliging fellow, so he got his friend, who is a barkeeper,
to mix up a couple of gallons and send it over to the clubhouse with
his compliments. The barkeeper thought it was for Fred's club so he
made it good and stiff. It was an innocuous looking mixture and tasted
innocent enough, so the club women said it was 'bully' and partook
freely.

"About twelve o'clock that night, somebody telephoned for Fred to come
quick. Just exactly what happened, Fred never would tell, but it cost
him about $40 for cab fares and an equal amount to keep it out of the
papers. Now, whenever one of the club women sees him, she crosses the
street.

"I don't believe there is any province in Heaven for the mannish
woman. If there is, I know lots of men who would enter upon a life of
crime rather than take a chance of going there when they die. I think
there is a special place in Hades, where the mannish woman will be
made to wear a mother-hubbard and let down her back hair. If there
isn't, Mephistopheles don't understand his business a little bit."




A WONDERFUL MACHINE.


"I see by one of the papers that a Chinaman has invented a typewriter
which writes in the Celestial language," said the Observer, handing
the bootblack a nickel and shaking hands with the crowd. "This
bright Oriental, who is known as Tap-Key, has undertaken a very large
contract, for the Chinese language, as most people know, is composed
entirely of word symbols, each of which represents a word; some
combining to form other words, as for instance, a square represents
a field, and a combination of 'man' and 'field' signifies a farmer;
while 'a man in a box' most graphically describes a prisoner, and 'two
women' typify 'gossip,' which is emphasized by adding another of the
fair sex, so that a half-dozen women in a row would probably mean the
direst kind of mischief.

[Illustration: Chinese typewriter]

"Well, to embrace any kind of a vocabulary, this machine would need to
have about 5,000 characters, and would require quite a force of men
to operate it, but the advantages which would accrue from its use are
almost inestimable. The Spaniards have found in the typewriter a most
effective instrument of war, and through its use many of Weyler's most
important battles were won. Reports from South Africa seem to indicate
that it has played no unimportant role in England's subjugation of the
Boers, and General Elwell S. Otis has even been accused of employing
it with terrible effect against the forces of Aguinaldo. With such an
awful weapon as Tap-Key has invented the Chinese government might defy
the allied powers with impunity and even regain the territory captured
by Japan. The young Emperor could doubtless put to flight the august
but doughty dowager, as well as his beloved relative, Prince Tuan,
and rule his flowery kingdom in peace and harmony, while Li Hung Chang
would lose his head, metaphorically, if not literally, in favor of
Tap-Key, future lord of the war department."




DRAWBACKS OF THE KING BUSINESS.


"No," said the Observer, thoughtfully, "I never cherished dreams
of inordinate wealth or power; there's nothing in it. If a man is
satisfied to reach a moderate altitude he may enjoy it unmolested, but
if he succeeds in scaling some remarkable height, there immediately
arises an army of envious cranks ready to take his life or make it so
miserable for him that he will be glad to sell out at half price and
gratefully descend into the obscurity from which he rose.

"Nor, is it only the self-made man to whom these remarks apply. Take,
for example, the Czar of Russia, the Emperor of Germany, or any
other potentate, Christian or heathen, civilized or savage, great or
small. He has more trouble to the square inch than a weather prophet.
Nicholas III is probably the worst off of them all. He gets up early
in the morning and shaves himself with a safety razor, while the court
chemist is analyzing his breakfast for traces of arsenic or prussic
acid; then he dons his bullet-proof coat, descends a private stairway
to a bomb-proof drawing-room and receives his meals on a dumb-waiter
from the laboratory with the chemist's certificate that all injurious
substances have been removed.

[Illustration: Nicholas III, shaving.]

"This is the latest method, an official taster having been formerly
employed, but owing to the exorbitant rate of insurance on such
officers and the rapid decimation of the royal retinue, that plan was
recently abandoned. After finishing his repast the Czar receives the
morning papers, previously disinfected, and after reading the news,
sentences a few nihilists to death by means of a long-distance
telephone.

[Illustration: The court chemist analyzes the Czar's breakfast.]

"In Germany the situation is almost as bad. The Kaiser spends the
entire morning endeavoring to suppress an incipient revolution, and
after convicting several editors for 'les majeste,' drives around the
streets of Berlin, wearing a baseball mask and making speeches to his
soldiers, upon whom he urges the necessity of constant watchfulness.

"The young potentate of the Celestial empire is not far behind. He
keeps one eye on the dowager and the other on Li Hung Chang, while he
sends out harikari mandates to troublesome officials, and stands off
the Russian ambassador. Last, but not least, is the Sultan of Turkey,
who has a large family to provide for and who keeps a man busy issuing
promissory notes to Uncle Sam so that his wives may be properly
supplied with filigree hair pins and divided skirts. They say he
recently bought the entire stock of an insolvent dry goods store for
his harem, and it only went half way around.

"The king business is not what it is cracked up to be. I know lots of
fellows who would make first-rate kings, and I don't know but what I
would make quite a hit in that line myself. But I wouldn't take the
job if I could get it. I'd sooner be chief of police or a corporation
lawyer. There's more money in it and not half the danger."




THE EATING HABIT


"My friend," said the Observer to his vis-a-vis, who was studying the
bill-of-fare on the other side of the table, "did you ever stop to
consider in what an advanced age we are living? Have you ever studied
the laws of the universe and sought to figure them out?"

"'Never had time,' you say; 'keeps a man busy providing cash to feed
his family.' Well, that's just the point. Have you never realized that
half of our time is spent in preparing, eating and digesting food,
while the other half is employed in making money enough to buy it?
Now, students of psychology say that, in time, the human body will
become so refined that it will be able to absorb all necessary
nourishment from 'universal life,' and need not gorge itself with
animal or vegetable organisms.

"What vast changes such a condition will inaugurate. The Frenchman
will no longer clog his digestive apparatus with 'pate de foi gras;'
the rodent will pursue the even tenor of his way in the land of the
heathen Chinee, without danger of being converted into a stew; the
aged mutton of Merrie England will gambol on the green, with chops
intact; the Teuton will forsake his sauerkraut; the benighted heathen
his missionary pot-pourri, and the ghosts of slaughtered canines shall
cease to haunt the sausage-maker of our own beloved country.

"It means the elimination of the dyspeptic and the 'autocrat of the
breakfast table,' who frowns coldly upon the efforts of his young wife
in the culinary line and carries off her biscuits to serve as paper
weights. The scoffer at occidental table manners will cease to cavil
at the genial westerner who eats vegetables with a knife, pie with
a spoon, and drinks his coffee from the saucer, a napkin tucked in
graceful folds beneath his ample chin.

"The picturesque phraseology of the Bowery-waiter will fade from
view when he ceases to hustle 'stacks of whites,' 'plainers,' and
'straight-ups' to waiting customers, or bawl a hoarse-voiced 'draw
one,' to the white-capped cook.

"The grafter will lack his usual excuse for making a 'touch;' the
after-dinner speech will no more pave the politician's ways to fame,
and the portrait of the baby that thrived on Malter's Malted Milk,
which now embellishes the pages of newspaper and magazine, will become
naught but a lingering memory of the past."




DELIGHTS OF FLASHLIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY.


"See those hands?" said the Observer, holding up two "bunches of
fives," whose digits were stained near the ends with some dark brown
substance, "that's pyrogallic acid--and that burn near my thumb was
made by Blitz Pulver. It wouldn't take a Sherlock Holmes to discover
that I had the camera craze, would it?

"The other day I went into a photographic supply house to look at some
of their cameras and the clerk sold me one of the kind that 'a child
can operate.' He didn't say where the child was to be found, but I
have since concluded that it must be a very remarkable specimen of the
infant prodigy, and is probably touring the country as a dime museum
attraction on the strength of its wonderful abilities.

[Illustration: Poor B. is kicked by a calf.]

"I took the camera home with me and carefully assimilated the printed
instructions which accompanied it, fixed up a dark room in the
woodshed and then sauntered proudly back with my machine under my arm
to photograph the baby.

"Now, I've always prided myself on the genial good nature of my
infant. He hardly ever cries or kicks the covers off, or becomes
afflicted with colic about 3 A.M. The butcher says he takes after me,
though my wife won't acknowledge this, notwithstanding the fact that
the butcher has six of his own and ought to know. Well, the moment
I came in, that kid, instead of rolling his eyes and saying,
'a-goo-goo,' which means 'papa,' as everyone knows, set up a regular
Comanche howl and threw his rattle at me. When I took him in my arms
and tried to quiet him, he clawed at my eyes, kicked a pocketful of
cigars to pieces and bellowed so vociferously that I gave him back to
his ma.

"After a while he began to listen to reason and I set up my outfit
near the window in order to have a good light. I tore down a blind and
ripped a lace curtain clear across in my effort to get two exposures,
and, Good Lord! you ought to see those prints.

"In the first snap I must have moved the camera, for I got only one
side of the baby, but that side had three different arms and you could
see the back of the chair through all of them. The second was normal,
as to limbs, etc., and plumb in the center, but it was all fuzzy, like
an impressionist picture.

"I took them to the photo' store and asked the clerk what was wrong.
He said:

"'Why, you've timed 'em too long. He's moved all over the plate. You
want to use a big stop and make it quick!'

"'But what do you make it of and what is it for?' I asked perplexedly.

"He laughed and explained that I should make the hole in my lens
larger and take a more rapid exposure; then he sold me a bottle of
flashlight powder.

"That night I thought I would take a group at the dinner table, so
we all assembled around the board. After knocking down a couple of
pictures and upsetting the cuspidor, I got things all ready to light
the fuse, expecting to get back to my chair and be in the picture
before the stuff went off. The moment I lit it, however, the durned
thing blazed up like a small volcano and I ran around the room for
a minute or so with my thumb in my mouth. Then I discovered that the
slide had not been withdrawn from the plate-holder. Well, the room
was full of smoke and the baby was so badly frightened that we had to
put him to bed before I could make another attempt. When my wife came
back I set the cat up in the high-chair to fill out the gap and tried
it again. This time, by using a long fuse and making a third-base
slide, I got almost to my chair and the prospects looked promising.
The result was an excellent view of the back of my head, occupying
three-fourths of the plate, through which could be dimly discerned a
silhouette of my wife and a black streak in mid-air which represented
the cat jumping over the coffeepot.

[Illustration: Poor B. hanging by his pantaloons on a fence-post.]

"I know a fellow, though, who had a worse experience than mine. He
took home a kodak and a 'creme de menthe' jag one night, and, as all
his folks had retired and he was too impatient to wait until morning,
he went out to the stable to flashlight the calf. The calf was too
sleepy to object till the stuff exploded. Then he became imbued with
such sudden and tremendous vitality that he kicked poor B. and his
outfit into the middle of next week. The hired man heard the racket
and found him hanging by his pantaloons on a fence-post. Part of the
tripod was about his neck; his hair was full of ground glass and he
was murmuring something about a trolley-car. They put him to bed and
the first thing he said after he came to, was, 'Did they arrest the
motorman?'

"I hear fellows talking about golf and driving four-in-hand, but, if
anyone wants to experience a real hot time, let him get one of these
easy-working cameras and practice on the family."




WONDERS OF SPIRITUALISM.


"Spiritualism is a wonderful thing," said the Observer in a
retrospective tone. "As a source of valuable information, it beats the
Encyclopedia Brittanica in an easy hand gallop; the tonsorial artist
is not in its class and even the 'Intelligence Office,' pales into
innocuous desuetude beside it.

"Had it not been for a recent visit to a medium, I should never have
learned many important truths which affect me very closely. In the
first place I should not have known that I have a little brother and
sister in 'spirit life.' I had always considered myself an only child
and all of my relatives and friends cherished the same illusion. You
may imagine my astonishment, then, at receiving messages from Brother
Charley and Sister Ida, both of whom the medium described with
marvelous attention to detail. They told me not to worry--that it
would all come right, and that they were always with me, which is
comforting and shows how affectionate children can be--even in spirit
life.

"The next revelation which came from the 'other side' was the
statement that a dark cloud which was then hovering over me, would
soon pass away. This was interesting as well as instructive and, as
I was idly speculating as to the exact location of the cloud, I was
suddenly startled to learn that two beautiful young women--one fair
and wealthy, the other dark and poor, but accomplished--had won my
heart and that I was hesitating as to which one I loved the more.

"This was somewhat distressing and wholly unpremeditated on my
part. I caught myself hoping, with a vague sense of guilt, that my
wife wouldn't hear of it, for I knew it would worry her and bring
about complications between us. Perhaps this was the dark cloud,
I ruminated, and felt cheered by the assurance that it would soon
pass away. The spirit that told me these things was evidently in
a communicative mood and had, no doubt, looked up my case very
carefully.

"'You are very sensitive,' she told me--I use the word 'she'
advisedly, for no masculine spirit could possibly have ferreted out
all these facts. 'You touch many natures closely and benefit by
this faculty.' I had just borrowed a little money from a friend and
wondered if anything personal was intended by the word 'touch.' But I
cast this thought aside as unworthy--no spirit would resort to slang.

"'Do you often hear voices, indistinctly?' continued the spirit,
'strange voices which seem to call you and then sink away?' I thought
of the telephone and wondered how she could have known.

"'Yes,' I said, I hear them every day.'

"'Ah!' said the spirit, 'you are mediumistic.'

"I started. 'Is it painful?' I asked, 'or likely to become chronic?'

"The medium sat bolt upright in her chair and rubbed her eyes
violently. 'Your levity has destroyed the conditions,' she said. 'Two
dollars, please.'

"I paid the money, and, in going out, I met a man looking at his watch
in an irritated way.

"'I engaged a sitting for 3 o'clock by telephone,' he said. 'Why have
I been kept waiting half an hour?'

"The medium's jaw dropped with peculiar suddenness and she sat down
heavily in a chair. A sudden revelation came to me.

"'Sir,' I said, addressing the stranger, 'pardon the inquiry, but have
you a Sister Ida and a Brother Charley in spirit life? Do you love two
women--one fair and wealthy, the other poor and dark, but talented?
Does a dark cloud hover over your life and do you hear voices calling
you from afar? Are you sensitive and have you developed the sense of
tou--?'

"'Enough!' cried the man, hoarsely. 'I am convinced--here is your
money,' and he handed me a five-dollar bill.

"'Thanks,' said I, and left them there together."




THE POTENCY OF THE TESTIMONIAL


"Did you ever read the testimonial letters of noted persons?" said the
Observer, thoughtfully, stirring his coffee. "There are many things
which come with fame besides public adulation; they are material
things and have a certain commercial as well as sentimental value,
such as soap and corsets, patent medicines, face powder, vapor baths,
books, cigars, corned beef, fountain pens, and patented trouser
hangers. As soon as a man gets his name in print a few times he is
deluged with samples by every manufacturer in the country. I know an
actor who hasn't bought a cake of toilet soap since he began to play
leading parts. All he's got to do is to write a testimonial for some
new brand, saying he would use no other, and he gets a case; then,
there is a leading lady who once endorsed a certain kind of shoe,
and now she's got a dozen pairs in her trunk, which didn't cost her
a cent.

"Among the personal effects of the late Senator D---- were six dozen
porous plasters and nearly a gross of Casey's Liver Regulator. Whether
the senator's demise was due to his strenuous efforts to deplete this
generous supply has never been made known, but I very much doubt if
the doctor, who attributed his death to heart failure was familiar
with these facts at the time.

"Another famous statesman, who was as bald as he was absent-minded,
once mailed a testimonial to the manufacturer of Blank's Hair
Restorer, enclosing a photograph of himself. In their next
advertisement they made two cuts from the picture, painting a
profusion of wavy hair upon one, and ran them over a reproduction of
his letter, labeled, 'Before and after using.' When the old gentleman
saw it he was so pleased with his appearance in the latter cut that he
straightforth bought a wig and ever afterwards kept up the delusion.

"Then there's the man who is cured by X-Y-Z Cough Cure, or Blither's
Sarsaparilla. He may not be known to half a hundred people before
he tries this wonderful stimulant; but after he takes half a dozen
bottles and is 'snatched from the jaws of death,' his name and
features become familiar to several millions of people. I know a
carpenter in a northern county who resorted to this method and was
so well advertised that, when the national representative for that
district died, B---- was nominated for Congress and elected by a big
majority.

"There is a saying that 'some men are born great; some achieve
greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.' I don't know who
made this statement, or why it was made, but it's dollars to doughnuts
that the fellow who did was saved from an untimely grave by the
curative powers of Bunker Hill Stomach Bitters and rose from obscurity
to high position as a result."

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: "They usually read * * * Dante's Inferno and think how
sweet it is to suffer."]

       *       *       *       *       *




AMBITIONS AND THINGS.


"Ambition is a good thing," said the Observer, deftly flicking the ash
from his cigar. "It provides one with a certain amount of incentive
which may prove useful in developing latent resources, but it ought to
be carried about in a glass case and labeled, 'Handle with care.'

"Caesar had an ambition, but he overworked it with disastrous effect.
Napoleon got good results from his for a while, but it finally gave
out on him, and William Jennings Bryan, the latest prominent victim
of ambition is in such a bad way that he has to ride on tourist
cars, like 'common people.' This may be due to a beautiful spirit of
consistency on his part, as editor of the 'Commoner,' but it is not in
line with his ambition. All of which goes to show that ambition is no
more subject to a guarantee than a patent-leather shoe--it looks very
fine when you first get it, but it cracks.

"Then there is the ideal, which is even more perishable, but can
fortunately be replaced when it breaks--for it does not wear out.
Like a Prince Rupert drop, it is just as good as new until something
steps on its tail, and then there is nothing left but a noise and a
disturbed atmospheric condition.

"After a fellow's ideal, explodes he generally idles away his time
pitying himself and saying sarcastic things about the entire human
race, until he achieves a local reputation as a cynic. When in this
state of mind there is no use in telling him that he is not the only
original possessor of a bona fide broken ideal. He'll show you a
little superficial scratch and say in husky tones, 'see this great
wound it has made in my constitution, it will never heal. Happiness
is an iridescent dream. Go and leave me to my fate! 'Then he'll heave
a sigh which he thinks comes from a broken heart, but which really
emanates from a dyspeptic condition, caused by lack of exercise. After
a while he finds that this brand of romance is an overcrowded field
and that he doesn't get sufficient sympathy to make it pay. When he
realizes that he is up against the competitive system good and hard,
he bids a fond farewell to sentiment and goes to work.

"It is interesting to watch young women, just after they lose an
ideal. They generally have more time to indulge the 'broken heart'
idea and do it so much more scientifically than men. It is very
effective to lounge about in a darkened room, wearing a pale, hopeless
expression and picturesque negligee. They usually read Faust and
Dante's Inferno and think how sweet it is to suffer.

"When friends come to cheer them up they sigh softly and say, 'Ah, no;
it is too late. Once I had aims and aspirations, but Fate has swept
them all away. I shall only drift and drift now, until it is all
over.'

"Then, the comforters go away with tears in their eyes and send her
flowers.

"'How the poor child has suffered,' they say. But Providence only has
a quiet laugh up her sleeve and says, as she winks the other eye,

"'What fools these mortals be!'"




THE TELEPHONE FACE


"What's the matter with that man?" said the Observer, repeating his
friend's interrogation, as they passed a pedestrian wearing a most
prodigious frown. "Don't you know what's the matter with him? He's got
the telephone face.

"Never heard of it, eh? Well, that shows that your powers of
perception are not particularly acute. The telephone face is no longer
a physiognomical freak, but a prevalent expression among the several
thousand unfortunate clerks and business men who find extensive use
for the telephone necessary. It is a distinctive cast of features,
too, which can readily be distinguished from any other by one who can
read faces at all.

"The dyspeptic has a 'face.' His expression is fitful and disgruntled,
but underlying it is a gleam of hope; the insolvent man, harassed by
creditors, has another well-defined type of facial mold. It is haunted
and worried, with a tinge of defiance in it; the owner of the 'bicycle
face' has his features set in lines of deadly resolution; the 'golf
face' displays fanatical enthusiasm and a puzzled look resulting from
a struggle with the vocabulary of the game; the 'poker face' shows
immobility and superstition; the 'telegraph face,' according to a
well-known New York professor, is 'vacant, stoic and unconcerned,' but
the 'telephone face' stands out among all of these in a class peculiar
to itself. There are traces of a battle and defeat marked on it; the
stamp of hope deferred and resignation, yet without that placidity
which usually betokens the acceptance of an inevitable destiny. The
brows are drawn together above the nose, and at times a murderous
glint shows in the half-closed eyes of the possessor.

"The peculiar feature about the man with the 'telephone face' is, that
he always believes the day will come when he will be able to get the
right number and the right man without being told that the 'line's
busy,' 'party does not reply,' or 'phone is out of order.' He is
like the man who always backs the wrong horse, the poet with an 'Ode
to Spring,' or the honest man seeking a political job, continually
defeated, but ever dreaming of ultimate success.

"I know of only one instance in which the dream was realized. A
new girl had been installed in a telephone office without proper
instructions--a most unprecedented case. A bookkeeper, grown gray
in the service of a large mercantile house, picked up his receiver
wearily. It rang the new girl's bell, and like a flash, she said,
'Hello.' The bookkeeper gasped. 'Is that you, Central?' he asked
huskily. 'Yes,' replied the unsophisticated maiden, pleasantly. 'What
number, please?' The old man sat bolt upright and clutched the desk.
'Give me purple six double-nine,' he said, in quavering tones, and
his weak form trembled as he spoke. Nimbly worked the fingers of the
uninitiated telephone girl, as she struck a peg in the switchboard and
quickly rang a bell. A voice at the other end responded promptly, and
the bookkeeper wiped cold beads of perspiration from his brow before
he answered. 'Is this Jones & Company?' he almost shrieked. 'Yes,'
came the reply, full and clear, 'this is Jones talking.'

"A dull thud followed, and, when the other clerks rushed in, they
found the old man lying still and cold, his right hand still grasping
the receiver of the telephone, which had fallen to the floor beside
him, and a smile of the most transcendent happiness they had ever
seen, upon his faded lips."

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
