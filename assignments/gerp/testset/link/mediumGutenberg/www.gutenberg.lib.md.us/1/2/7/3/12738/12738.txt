    (_Par_ DICK DODY, _Auteur de "Le Nabab Boffin-Newcome,"
    "Madame de Marneffe Jeune et Rawdon Crawley Commercant,"
    "Trente Ans a prendre mon bien partout," "La Lie de mon
    Encrier," "Raclure des Petits Journaux," &c, &c._)

I.--LE HIGLIFE SCOLASTIQUE.

Le recteur regardait avec un air egrillard le museau chiffonne de la
jolie Madame COPPERFIELD, qui desirait lui confier son petit garcon
comme eleve dans l'institution la plus distinguee de tout Paris, une
maison ou chaque enfant devait apporter dans sa petite malle trois
couverts en vermeille, et un trousseau de six douzaines de chemises
en batiste fine; une maison ou les extras, les vin d'oporto, les
beef-tea, les sandwich, souvent depassaient la pension.

"Voyons, ma belle dame," dit le recteur, "comment s'appelle-t'il--ce
petit mome--pardon--ce cher enfant?"

"DOMBEY, Monsieur, JONNIE DOMBEY. JONNIE sans l'H."

"Il est noble?"

"Mais, non, Monsieur. Son pere etait banquier, financier, que sais-je!
Il faisait des affaires enormes--gigantesques! Il regardait les
ROTHSCHILD comme de nouveaux venus--il--" et la gentille petite
COPPERFIELD se perdait dans un labyrinthe de phrases, et se refugiait
dans une enorme houppe a poudre-Sarah, qu'elle portait toujours dans
son manchon.

ELISABETH TROTTEBOIS.]

"Mais il n'etait pas noble," dit le recteur, avec durete; "je
regrette fort, Madame, de ne pouvoir accepter votre petit gosse--votre
fils--comme eleve; mais cette institution scolastique est des plus
_fashionables_ de Paris. Si vous aviez une petite couronne de Marquise
sur votre carte de visite, si vous etiez descendue d'une voiture
blasonnee aux chevaux fringants, avec cocher en perruque spun-glass,
mes bras de pere spirituel se seraient ouverts avec effusion pour
accueillir cet enfant. Mais vous portez sur votre oarte un nom
suspect, et vous etes arrivee en voiture de place. Ainsi avec la
plus haute consideration je dois vous prier de prendre la peine
de debarrasser le plancher. Adieu, mon petit bonhomme. Tu as l'air
scrofuleux mais charmant."

Madame COPPERFIELD, qui etait entree comme Zephire partit comme Boree.
Sa robe de soie faisait un frou-frou prodigieux dans le vestibule.
Elle monta dans la voiture au cheval etique, aux coussins moisis,
tirant le petit JONNIE avec une violence hysterique.

"Parceque tu n'est pas fils de Marquis on m'outrage," elle dit,
fondant en larmes. "Et pourquoi n'est-tu pas fils de Marquis, petite
brute? Moi, je ne sais pas."

Le petit DOMBEY sautait sur les genoux de sa mere; il la consolait,
et quelques instants plus tard mere et fils sucaient emsemble un grand
morceau de butter-scotch, pendant que la petite ecervelee considerait
le costume qu'elle devait porter le soir au Bal Bullier.

II.--UN GYMNASE A TOUTES LES COULEURS.

MADAME COPPERFIELD ne se tenait pas pour vaincue sur cette question
d'une pension pour le petit. Sa cuisiniere lui soufflait le nom d'un
Monsieur SQUEERS qui habitait dans les environs de Clichy, et cette
fois c'etait la cuisiniere qui conduisait le petit JONNNIE chez son
alumnus; et la cuisiniere ne faisait pas de facons; c'etait a prendre
ou a laisser.

Le bon SQUEERS, qui avait habite auparavant le Yorkshire, avait
developpe une goutte de sang negre, et s'etait etabli avec la seconde
Madame SQUEERS (soeur cadette de la respectable Madame MICAWBER) dans
les environs de Clichy. Malheureusement il n'avait pas oublie son
systeme anglais, et quoiqu'il faisait bien des raffinements sur les
rudes et franches pratiques de Dotheboys, le systeme etait au fond le
meme. Il lui fallait toujours sa victime--son SMIKE. A Dotheboys le
SMIKE etait blanc, et s'attachait a NICHOLAS, le pion; a Clichy le
SMIKE etait noir, mais c'etait toujours bien SMIKE, qui entrait dans
la pension bien vetu, ses frais payes ponctuellement, et qui tombait
bien bas, jusqu'a balayer le plancher, et a servir a table. Et plus
tard le SMIKE noir devait mourir accable de cruautes, d'une mort
encore plus larmoyante et plus terrible que la douce phthisie du
SMIKE blanc. Il est mort dans la seconde maniere de DICKENS, plus
travaillee, plus tendue que le style jeune et fort de NICKLEBY.

III.--CE QU'ON APPELLE UN BEAU-PERE.

Il n'y a pas loin du premier chapitre dans la vie de JONNIE jusqu'a
l'entree de MURDSTONE--le MURDSTONE francais, dur, mais poete, ainsi
plus frivole que le MURDSTONE anglais. Mais, puisque pour le petit
ARRIE tout ce qu'il y a de penible dans l'histoire de son petit cousin
anglais doit s'augmenter, le MURDSTONE francais a des traits des
NERON et des CALIGULA. Naturellement le jeune DOMBEY, se souvenant
des escapades du cousin, fait son petit voyage d'enfant--une fuite
de la pension jusqu'a la maison maternelle ou la petite dame s'est
installee en secondes noces avec MURDSTONE D'ARGENTON, le poete. Alors
commencent l'education de l'enfant par le beau-pere, les larmes de la
mere, le martyre du petit. Que de gifles; que de dictionnaires lances
a la tete du chetif bambin!

"Faut qu'il aille quelque part gagner sa vie," dit MURDSTONE, qui
s'enrageait de plus en plus, a cause de deux incommodites dans leur
vie de famille, la premiere que lui, MURDSTONE, n'avait pas le genie
d'ALFRED DE MUSSET, la seconde que l'enfant avait un rhume de cerveau
incurable. "Envoyez-le laver les bouteilles chez un marchand de vins,"
proposait un ami de la maison.

"Mais, non, cela ne serait pas assez dur," repondit le poete. "Je suis
fache qu'il n'y ait plus a Londres ce bon systeme de ramoneurs-garcons
qu'on faisait bruler vifs quelquefois dans les cheminees. Faute de
cela je le mettrai sur la voie ferree, a graisser les roues avec son
petit pot de pommade jaune--et si par hasard il se faisait ecraser par
un train--tant pis pour lui."

Il etait grand garcon maintenant, ce joli petit JONNIE du premier
chapitre, et avant de partir pour se perdre entre les Parias du pot a
graisse sur la ligne d'Est, il s'enhardit jusqu'a questionner sa mere
sur un sujet qu'elle avait approche de temps en temps gentillement du
bout des levres, en lui soufflant des idees romanesques, des visions
de ducs espagnols et de millionnaires anglais.

"Dis done, p'tite Maman, comment s'appelait-il, mon pere?"

"Mais, mon cheri, naturellement, il s'appelait COPPERFIELD."

"Mais, Maman, tu me disais autrefois qu'il etait DOMBEY, un grand
financier, riche a millions. Se peut-il que de DOMBEY je sois devenu
COPPERFIELD?"

La pauvre inconsequente sanglotait avec vehemence--"Mon JONNIE, je
te trompais. DOMBEY, le financier raide et hautain, n'a jamais existe
dans la vie reelle. C'etait un mannequin en bois. Ton pere etait
DICKENS, le grand romancier anglais. Il est mort avant ta naissance.
Sans lui tu ne serais pas."

TO A CORRESPONDENT.--We do not think you are wise to have asked a
large circle of distinguished French sporting friends to bring their
rods over with a view to salmon-fishing in the Serpentine. Trout,
there may be; no doubt, there are, but we have some doubts about
salmon. Your suggestion that if you can't get a rise you might perhaps
"bang away" at the waterfowl, certainly has a more promising sound,
but we would advise you to commence your sport early, for fear of
hitting the bathers. You will require the permission of the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE. This you will get through any Park-keeper.

[Illustration: THE FINAL TEST.

_Bellona_ (_to the "Times" and Mr. Stanhope_). "I SUPPOSE,
GENTLEMEN, YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR _ME_ TO SETTLE THE
QUESTION!"

TOMMY ATKINS, _loquitur_:--

  Oh, where and _wot_ am I? A spindle-shank'd stripling,
    As blue-gilled old Tory ex-Colonels protest?
  Or a 'ero, as pictured by young RUDYARD KIPLING,
    Six foot in my socks, forty-inch round the chest?
  I'm blowed if _I_ know arter all the discussion.
    But if I'm the cove as they're going to trust,
  To give good account of yer Frenchy or Russian,
    At least they'd best give me a gun as won't _bust_.
  They've bin fighting this battle of barrels and breeches,--
   Ah yus, from the days of our poor old Brown Bess,
  And wot's the result as their 'speriments teaches?
    They'd better jest settle it sharp-like, I guess.
  If once of a rattlin' good rifle I'm owner,
    A thing as won't jack-up or jam, I don't care.
  But if they stand squabblin' till Missis BELLONER
    Puts in _'er_ appearance, there'll be a big scare.
  Ah, she's the true "Expert"; wuth fifty Committees!
    But then '_er_ decision means money--and blood.
  Wot price TOMMY ATKINS, _then_? Everyone pities
    His fate, when he's snuffed it, and pity's no good.
  Whether STANHOPE is right, or the _Times_, I ain't sayin';
    But here Marm BELLONER gives both a big hint,
  As it's rayther a touch-and-go game they are playin',
    And TOMMY, he thinks she is right,--plain as print!]

Look out for _Mr. Punch Among the Planets_! He is a Star of the
first magnitude, and the above is the title of his Christmas Number.
It will issue from, to use astrological language, the House of
BRADBURY-AGNEW-&-CO., although the sidereal and celestial subjects
of the forthcoming Christmas Number are suggestive of the old days
of "BRADBURY and Heavens."

THREE TASTES.

I.

  My pipe, he tastes of turpentine--
    He is a penny pipe--
  A taste that every pipe of mine
    Has when he is not ripe.
  I bought him at a little shop
    Where they sell fruit and cheese,
  Tobacco, toys, and ginger-pop,
    And said, "A _cheap_ pipe, please."

  It was a maiden sold him me,
    And she was proud and cold;
  She'd briar pipes at two-and-three
    For them that squandered gold;
  She'd one that had a leather case.
    Item, a curly stem;
  And cheap pipes make her shrug her face,
    She had such scorn of them.

II.

  My pipe he tastes of cherry now;
    Gone, like the foam of wine,
  Gone, like the mist from mountain-brow,
    Gone is that turpentine.
  With the pure herb I feel it blend--
   That charm of cherry-wood,
  And smoke him six times straight on end,
    Because he is so good.

  And yet my aunt gets up, and sniffs,
    And therewith wags her head;
  And warns me in between the whiffs
    That I shall soon be dead;
  And says excessive smoking must
    Debase and bring me low,
  She makes herself offensive, just
    Because she loves me so.

III.

  My pipe, he tastes of chocolate,
    And he has grown so dear so dear,
  That I get up at half-past eight
    And smoke till night is here.
  My aunt informs me that the smell
    Is ranker than before--
  I could not love her half so well
    Loved I not baccy more.

  The female mind! The female mind!
    How beautiful it is!
  And yet it has to sit behind
    When it's compared with this--
  This taste that falls upon my pipe,
    That calms when woman clacks,
  In the sweet season when he's ripe,
    And just before he cracks.

THE MAGIC HORSE.

(_A PARALLEL NOT TO BE PUSHED TOO FAR._)

[Illustration]

    ["You are likewise to understand that MALAMBRUNO told me that,
    whenever fortune should direct me to the knight who was to be
    our deliverer, he would send him a steed--not like the vicious
    jades let out for hire, for it should be that very wooden
    horse upon which PETER of Provence carried off the fair
    MAGALONA.... MALAMBRUNO, by his art, has now got possession
    of him, and by this means posts about to every port of the
    world."

    "Hoodwink thyself, _Sancho_," said _Don Quixote_, "and get
    up.... And supposing the success of the adventure should not
    be equal to our hopes, yet of the glory of so brave an attempt
    no malice can deprive us.... The whole company raised their
    voices at once, calling out, 'Speed you well, valorous
    Knight! heaven guide thee, undaunted Squire! Now you fly
    aloft!'"--_Adventures of Don Quixote_.]

  Yes, "Speed you well, most valorous Knight!
    Heaven guide you!"--and sound sense inspire you!
  Small marvel that our land's black blight
    Of want and misery should fire you,
  Or any man whose heart will mourn
    More for wrecked lives than broken crockery.
  This picture is not shaped in scorn,
          Nor meant in mockery.

  La Mancha's Knight, though brave, was blind,
    Squire _Sancho_ just a trifle credulous,
  But our dear Don was nobly kind,
    And in the cause of suffering sedulous.
  If, mounting MALAMBRUNO's steed,
    He showed more sanguine than sagacious,
  He was not moved by huckster greed,
          Or pride edacious.

  But "with what bridle is he led?
    And with what halter is he guided?"
  Asked _Sancho_, rubbing his clown's head.
    So they who have the least derided
  Your plan for floating "the submerged,"
    Colossal, costly, wide extending,
  Feel some few questions may be urged,
          Without offending.

  Benevolence the crupper mounts,
    His arms, like _Sancho's_, from behind fold;
  But it would seem, from all accounts,
    He, like _Don Quixote's_ Squire, rides blindfold;
  It may be to most glorious ends,
    It may be to disastrous spillings.
  Sense fain would know before it spends
          Its hard-earned shillings.

  If all were genuine that is Big,
    If all were sound that's well intended,
  _Quixote's_ wild jaunt and _Sancho's_ jig
    Would very differently have ended.
  Zeal boldly mounts the Magic Horse,
    Charity on behind holds tightly,
  Who will not wish them skill and force
          To guide it rightly?

  But Human Life's a complex maze,
    And Nature's laws are most despotic.
  Vice is not killed by kindly craze.
    Nor suffering quelled by zeal Quixotic.
  Big questions the Big Scheme beset.
    Bid Pity _think_, and do not ask it
  Too blindly all its eggs to get
          In one huge basket.

  Philanthropy, which facts will school,
    Is not a theme for mocking merriment.
  As MORLEY says, he is the fool
    Who never ventures bold experiment.
  Against the ills our State that shake,
    The spectre Vice, Want the pale ogress,
  _Punch_ hopes the Magic Horse may make
          Practical progress.

RIGHT-DOING ON THE RIALTO;

OR, THE MODERN SHYLOCK.

(_A SHORT SHAKESPEARIAN SEQUEL._)

    _Enter the_ MODERN SHYLOCK _and_ BARINGO BROTHERS.

_Shylock_. Five Millions sterling for three months? And this
  You say, they will advance, if you can show
  Sufficient guarantee?

_Baringo_.        Indeed 'tis so.

_Shy._ Well, well! But how comes it about that you
  Whose honoured name has so long held the sway
  Of all safe dealing, that men only asked,
  "If a BARINGO backed it," to take up
  Unquestioning the newest stock,--should thus
  With sudden flash flare up and set in blaze
  The whole commercial world?

_Bar._        Oh! press me not,
  Nor question me too closely! "_Argentines_!"
  That fatal word sums up the evil spell
  That in these latter luckless days has fallen
  Upon our swaying House.

_Shy._        I see your case!
  A cry for gold finds you all unprepared,
  Your capital locked up beyond the seas.
  You cannot realise.

_Bar._        Alas! too true!
  That is the situation!

_Shy._        Badly done!
  Ah! it has been a sorry piece of work,
  Your "management."

_Bar._        I bow my head to that!
  But you will lend your aid? You'll pull us through?

_Shy._ Listen, BARINGO. Many a time and oft
  In this English land men have rated me
  About my moneys and my usuries.
  But that is long ago; the times have changed,
  And feeling in more righteous channel set,
  Now turns itself in flood to sweep away
  The wrongs of vanished years. Nay, more than this.
  But yesterday one of my ancient race,
  Filled, with his Christian colleagues' heartiest will,
  The civic throne; and at this very hour
  A protest from all classes in the land
  From low and high, from peasant and from peer,
  Goes forth to plead with the despotic power
  That 'neath brute persecution's iron heel
  Would trample out my brethren's life. So, there,
  Which way I look I meet a greeting hand.
  So, not repeating here the vengeful plot
  Of the old _Shylock_ of the play; without
  My pound of flesh or pound of anything,--
  But solely for the bond of brotherhood
  That should link loyal workers in one field,
  Count on my help in this your stress--for I
  Will be your guarantee!

_Bar._ You will! Oh, thanks
  For such blest help!

_Shy._ Such help is only right,--
  So say no more!

_Bar._ (_aside_.) Thank Heaven! _That
  Ends our plight!_

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Here are some regular sea-breezy Nautical stories for our youthful
Islanders. _From Middy to Admiral of the Fleet_, by Dr. MACAULAY,
which is a good long step; but this is the life of Commodore ANSON.
_Up North in a Whaler_, by EDWARD A. RAND; a pleasant little trip
for the Summer holidays--not inviting now--but try it later. Messrs.
HUTCHINSON & Co. also publish "_The Low-Back'd Car_," by SAMUEL
LOVER--an old Song in a fresh setting of charming Illustrations, by W.
MAGRATH. "We don't kill a pig every day!" But just for once and away
get _My Prague Pig_, by S. BARING GOULD. W. CLARK RUSSELL's _Master
Rockafellar's Voyage_, recommended.

To the ambitious young entertainer, _Magic at Home_, translated by
Professor HOFFMAN, will be a source of delight, and if some of the
experiments should lead to slight temporary inconvenience, it will
only help to pass a more cheerful evening than usual.

[Illustration: The Mirror of Justice.]

For drawing-room plays apply to GEORGE ROUTLEDGE, who publishes a set,
one of which, _Acting Charades and Proverbs_, by ANNE BOWMAN, will be
found very useful. A Bowman hits the mark.

Those who know their London _au bout des angles_, can tell you of
many quaint spots of beauty, which may be seen when it is not quite
enveloped in a cheerful fog, though several of the more ancient
landmarks are fast vanishing; yet in _Picturesque London_, by PERCY
FITZGERALD, M.A., F.S.A., will be found a happy collection of all the
most taking parts, both in odd corners, and interesting structures.
Charming illustrations by HUME, NISBET, and HERBERT RAILTON.

Christmas special numbers are not exactly up to date; they are turned
out so early that by the time they ought to be seasonable, they are
almost ancient history. _The Ladies' Pictorial_ is filled with short
stories by popular authors, which are well illustrated.

The earlier part of _My Life_, by SIDNEY COOPER, R.A., is very
interesting, as must almost always be the story of the early career
of such an ancient mariner as is this well-known animal-painter. There
must be a halo of romance about recollections which no one living can
or cares to contradict. When these biographical reminiscences come
within the memory of middle-aged men, then this said memory doth run
somewhat to the contrary of that of the veteran painter who put the
cart before the horse, so to speak, in his artistic career, seeing
that he commenced with carriages and ended with cows. As far as _Mr.
Punch_ is concerned, the Baron has already denied that DOUGLAS JERROLD
was ever the Editor of _Mr. P.'s_ paper; and Mr. COOPER's account of
the _Punch_ dinners must be taken with the contents of a well-filled
salt-cellar, as Mr. SIDNEY COOPER was never present at any one of
them. Inaccurately he attributes a repartee of THACKERAY's to DOUGLAS
JERROLD; and the well-known retort of JERROLD to ALBERT SMITH he gives
so incorrectly, that in this instance the Attic salt has lost its
savour. There is too much soft-soapiness in his reminiscences of
personal interviews with Royalty to please robust readers. Judging
from the latter portion of the second volume, wherein, as I should
take it, there is considerable "padding," it would seem that "the aged
P." has already secured an excellent position among "the immortals."
Hitherto it was generally supposed that of the arts Music alone would
survive _in saecula saeculorum_; but perhaps, after all, Painting has a
chance, and especially animal painting, even though the animals may be
allegorical. With its pardonable defects of memory, and its occasional
touch of Royal Windsor Livery complaint, the reminiscences of SIDNEY
COOPER, R.A., are pleasant and, of the first volume especially be it
said, interesting reading.

HOW IT'S DONE.

(_A HANDBOOK TO HONESTY._)

NO. VI.--"AN ALARMING SACRIFICE"--SOMEWHERE!

  SCENE I.--_A Suburban Drawing-room, old-fashionedly furnished;
    brightly-bound books scattered about a solid, sombre-covered
    table; oil portraits of elderly, stiffly attitudinising
    couple on the walls; a general atmosphere of simple, pietistic
    propriety. Present,_ EDWIN _and_ ANGELINA, _a modest, but
    deeply-enamoured pair, shortly about to be married._

_Edwin_ (_after the regulation ceremonial_). My dearest ANGELINA, I
have something here which I think will greatly simplify the business
of house-furnishing, that has so deeply occupied us lately.

[Illustration]

ANGELINA (_flushing tenderly_). Oh, EDWIN, _have_ you? How nice, dear!
And what is it?

_Edwin_ (_eagerly_). Quite providential, I call it. You know, dearest,
I've saved three hundred pounds for the express purpose; and here
is an advertisement, according to which, for about that sum, we can
secure a complete fit-out for our little villa, which, I think, will
exactly suit us. Quite an exceptional chance, as the advertiser
says. A gentleman, lately arrived in this country from India, is
unexpectedly compelled to return immediately. Consequently he
is obliged to dispose _at once_ of his lately-purchased house of
furniture, _at a great sacrifice_. It is as good as new, in fact, has
hardly been used at all; is elegant and substantial, and can be seen
any day at Vamp Villa, Barnsbury, upon presentation of visiting-card.
Suppose, dearest ANGY, we run over to-morrow afternoon, and have a
look at it? Such a chance--in the very nick of time, too--may never
occur again!

_Angelina_. Oh, EDWIN, _how_ fortunate! Should it suit us, what a lot
of trouble it will save!

_Edwin_. And money, too, darling, for the prices seem to be _very_
low. I'm so glad you agree, dear.

_Angelina_ (_with effusion_). Of _course_ I do, EDWIN. And (_with
tender glance at one of the oil pictures_) how delighted dear Mamma
will be! [_Osculation, appointment, and exit_.

  SCENE II.--_Mysterious-looking Villa at Barnsbury, permeated
    by strong smell of French-polish and fusty straw. Large "House
    to Let" boards and posters prominently disposed. Present._
    EDWIN _and_ ANGELINA, _and a blandly loquacious person, in
    black broadcloth, with a big foolscap-paper Inventory, and a

_Loquacious Person_ (_fluently_). Why you see, Madam, Mr. PAWNEE
LIVERLESS 'ad to leave for Bombay early yesterday mornin', and was
therefore obliged to leave the sale of his furniture in our hands.
But he is an old client of ours, Mr. LIVERLESS is, and he has given us
_carte blanche_ as regards the disposition of his effects. Only they
_must_ be sold at once. A retired Colonel at Notting Hill, who seemed
_very_ sweet on the bargain, promised me a decided answer by twelve
o'clock to-day. It has not come, and I am free to negotiate with
the next comer for the furniture as it stands, provided an immediate
settlement can be arrived at. _Wait_ I cannot, but in any other
pertikler I shall be only _too_ 'appy to meet your views.

_Edwin_. I see the furniture is quite new?

_L.P._ (_with cheery candour_). Well, no Sir, not quite. Oh, I'll not
deceive you! It has been in use a few months, and, as you see, is none
the worse for _that_. Better, if anything, being fully tested as to
seasoning. I need 'ardly tell _you_, Sir, that new furniture nowadays
is a ticklish thing to invest in. _Such_ tricks, my dear Sir, _such_
nefarious dodges and artful fakements! (_Sighs._) But--(_taking up a
chair and banging it vigorously but adroitly on the floor_)--_this_
is stuff you can depend on, and 'll be better three years hence than
it is to-day. This saddle-bag _sweet_, Madam, is simply luxurious,
good enough for any doocal dinin'-room; the carpets throughout
are as elegantly hesthetick in design, as they are substantial in
fabric, whilst the--ahem! sleeping apartments, are perfect pickters
of combined solidity and chaste elegance. _I_ always say, that as
a real gentleman is known by his linen, so the 'ome of a party
of true taste may be tested by the bed-rooms. You'll excuse me,
Madam--(_smirks_)--but such are _my_ sentiments, _not_ as a salesman,
but as a family man.

    [L.P. _takes_ EDWIN _and_ ANGELINA _the round of the
    house, expatiating glowingly but discreetly as he goes, and
    ultimately effects sale of the "furniture as it stands" for
    a liberally proffered "ten-pun note off the advertised sum
    tottle."_

  SCENE III.--_Interior of Greengage Villa_. ANGELINA (_now_
    Mrs. CANOODLE) _discovered in tears over the wreck of a
    "Saddlebag" Sofa, very shaky as to legs, and shabby as to
    "pile."_

_Angelina_ (_sobbing_). And to think that _dear_ EDWIN should have
spent his long savings on such wretched stuff as _this_! Oh, that
talkative but treacherous tout at Vamp Villa! Why, 'tis only six
months since we were married--(_bohoo!_)--and there's scarcely a thing
in the house that's not either shaky, or shabby, or both!

    [_Breaks down._

_Edwin_ (_entering with a flushed face, and clenched fists_). ANGY,
my darling, _don't_ waste your tears over that vile combination of
unseasoned timber and devil's-dust. Rather pluck up a spirit and
pitch into _me_, who was fool enough to be tricked by a plausible
advertisement, a scheming vendor of shoddy furniture, a hired villa,
a verbose villain, and the thrice-told tale of a mythical "Indian
gentleman," an imaginary "emergency," and a purely supposititious
"sacrifice." [_Left lamenting._

"A DANIEL!"

[Illustration: G.O.M. DANIEL in the Irish Lions' Den.]

Years ago, when BRITON RIVIERE painted his picture of "_Daniel in the
Lions' Den_," which foppishly-speaking men would speak of as "_Deniel
in the Lions' Dan_," public curiosity was aroused by the fact that
DANIEL was facing the lions with his back to the spectators. Of
course, in this instance, the public mind is not exercised by the
problem which was put to the Showman by an inquiring small boy, in the
memorable formula of inquiry, "Please, Sir, which is DANIEL, and which
is the Lions?" as never, for one moment, could there have existed, in
the densest brain, the smallest doubt as to the identity of the Hebrew
Seer. Should the question now be put by an intending purchaser, Mr.
WILLIAM AGNEW has only to give an adaptation of the historic reply,
and say, "Whichever you like, my little dear; _if_ you pay your money,
you may take your choice."

Now in this grand picture there is no sort of doubt, "no possible
doubt whatever," as to which is DANIEL and which are the Lions; but
there must arise in the spectator's mind the question, _Who was the
painter's model for this figure of_ DANIEL? To this there can be but
one answer, "the G.O.M." This is the painter's model for DANIEL. Here
he stands looking up towards the opening and seeing daylight. His
hands are tied by the bonds of a majority against him. As for the
Lions they may be Irish Lions, who may be thinking of another grand
old DAN, The Liberator, but who, once upon a time, in the good old
Kilmainham Gaol days, would have fallen upon this G.O.M. and torn him
in pieces; not so now. It is a grand picture.

THE PARLIAMENTARY "ANCIENT MARINER."

(_FRAGMENTS FROM THE LATEST RENDERING OF THE OLD RIME._)

[Sidenote: An Ancient Mariner meeteth Three Guests bidden to St.
Stephen's and detaineth one.]

  It is an ancient Mariner,
  And he stoppeth one of three.
  "By thy scant gray looks and glittering eye,
  Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?"

  "St. Stephen's doors are open wide,
  My duty lies within;
  M.P.'s are met, the programme's set,
  May'st hear the Irish din."

  He holds him with his sinewy hand,
  "There was a ship," quoth he.
  "Hold off! unhand me, Ancient One!"
  Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

[Sidenote: St. Stephen's Guest is spell-bound by the eye of the Grand
Old Seafaring Man, and constrained to hear his tale.]

  He holds him with his glittering eye--
  St. Stephen's Guest stands still,
  And listens, like Midlothian's mob.
  The Mariner hath his will.

  St. Stephen's Guest stands like a stone.
  He cannot chuse but hear;
  And thus outspeaks that ancient man,
  The bright-eyed Mariner.

  Our ship was cheered, the harbour cleared
  Merrily did we drop
  Below the Kirk, Tory ill-will
  Our vessel might not stop.

[Sidenote: The Mariner tells how his new-launched Craft, after some
adverse gales, sailed northward, with a good wind, and fair weather.]

  The sun arose, that erst had left
  Our Home-Rule argosy,
  And he shone bright, our course was right,
  The "flowing tide" ran free.

  Higher and higher every day
  Our sun shone bright and clear--
  St. Stephen's Guest here beat his breast,
  For he heard the loud "Hear! Hear!"

[Sidenote: St. Stephen's Guest heareth that business is toward within;
but the monologuising Mariner continueth his tale.]

  The Speaker hath paced into the House,
  Toward his lofty place;
  Gleaming like gold before him goes
  The merry, massive Mace.

  St. Stephen's Guest he beat his breast,
  Yet he could not chuse but hear;
  And thus spake on that ancient man,
  The garrulous Mariner.

    [But behold the tale that was told unto St. Stephen's Guest by
    the Ancient Mariner is now known unto all men, from repeated
    and prolix narrations; the tale to wit of the Mariner's
    startling adventure in unsailed seas on board his suddenly
    launched _Home Rule_ Argo; how that the Ancient Mariner shot
    the Oof Bird (that made the (financial) mare to go, and the
    (party) breeze to blow); how that his shipmates cried out
    against the Ancient Mariner for killing the bird of good luck,
    which lay the golden eggs, but how, when the fog cleared off,
    they justified the same, and thus made themselves accomplices
    in the act; how "the spell began to break;" how "the Mariner
    hath been cast into a trance, and the angelic power" (of
    speech) "causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than"
    (ordinary) human "life could endure"; how in the Mariner's
    opinion the _Home Rule_ Argo yet "stoppeth the way," and until
    it hath free course must impede the fair navigation of the
    (political) ocean; and how, finally, he, the Ancient Mariner,
    is constrained to "pop up" and repeat this tale of change and
    chance unto the appointed persons.]

       *       *       *       *       *

  Forthwith this tongue of mine was stirred
  To quenchless fluency,
  Which forced me to begin my tale,
  As now I tell it thee.

  Since then, at an uncertain hour,
  This ecstasy returns;
  And till my thrice-told tale is through
  The heart within me burns.

  I pass, like _Puck_, from land to land,
  I have strange power of speech;
  That moment that his face I see
  I know the man that must hear me,
  To him my tale I teach.

         *       *       *       *       *

  What loud uproar bursts from that door!
  They're at it hotly there:
  Will they be silenced by the tale
  Told by the Mariner?
  Bim! Boom! There goes Big Ben's deep bell!
  The Speaker's in the Chair!

  SCENE--_Celebrated London Barracks. Fire just broken out in
    top storey of Married Soldiers' Quarters, crowded with women
    and children. Soldiers rushing for ladders. Some children
    handed up through a trap-door, which is supposed to lead to
    roof. No exit on to roof available, and children being slowly
    smothered. Screams. Great excitement._

_Non-Commissioned Officer_. Ha! Fire in the "Rookery!" And it'll burn
like paper, being old and rotten! Now, where's the fellow who ought to
have the key of the hydrant? (_Exit in search of him._)

_Labourer employed at Barracks_ (_entering hastily_). Hullo! A fire!
Where's that key of mine for the hydrants? Can't attend to _that_,
however, as there's my wife and family to be saved! (_Rushes out, and
hydrants cannot be unlocked for ten minutes. When they are, they are
found to be without water!_)

_Colonel Commanding the Battalion_ (_just arrived on scene_). No
water! Well, of course there isn't! Hasn't the War Office ordered it
to be turned off at night, spite of my protests? Tell the Fire-Brigade
men to get water wherever they can!

    [_Water eventually got in roads several hundred yards from
    burning building._

_Non-Com. Officer_ (_directing two soldiers, who have gallantly
rescued a couple of children that have been burning and suffocating
under roof_). Yes, take 'em off to the hospital! Poor little
creatures--not much hope for _them_, I'm afraid! (_To Colonel._) A bad
business, Sir!

_Colonel_. Would have been worse if the men hadn't behaved so well,
and turned themselves into amateur firemen. No thanks to the War
Office that there aren't twenty-two deaths, instead of two. Why,
only six months ago, I warned 'em that the place was "unfit for human
habitation," and a regular death-trap in case of fire, with only one
narrow wooden staircase to the whole block. I wrote that, "if a fire
occurred at night, there must be many deaths." Yet nothing has been
done.

_Non-Com. Officer_. Shocking! There's a talk that the place had been
condemned by the War Office.

_Colonel_. Condemned, but not pulled down! I wonder who'll be
condemned at the Inquest. Shouldn't be surprised if it were the
War-Office Authorities themselves!

    [_And so they have been--and quite right too_.

THE MODERN HERO;

_OR, HOW TO DISCOURAGE CRIME._

HENRY LARRIKIN, who was recently convicted and sentenced to death
for the murder of a nursemaid and infant on Shooter's Hill, is now
confined in ---- Gaol, and is reported to be in excellent spirits.
He passes his time in illuminating texts, which he presents to the
Governor and Warders, and some of which have been disposed of for
enormous sums. A petition has been circulated, and extensively signed,
praying for a remission of his sentence, on the ground of provocation,
it having since transpired that the infant put out its tongue in
passing. Several Jurymen have said, that had this fact been brought
before them at the trial, they would have returned a very different
verdict. Much sympathy is expressed with LARRIKIN, who is quite a
young man. He expresses himself as sanguine of a reprieve.

CENTRAL NEWS TELEGRAM.--LATER INTELLIGENCE.

_Monday_.--LARRIKIN was informed this afternoon, by the Governor of
the Gaol, that the HOME SECRETARY saw no grounds for interfering with
the course of the Law, and that the sentence would consequently be
carried out on Friday next. Two of the Warders, with whom LARRIKIN is
a great favourite, on account of the affability and singular modesty
of his demeanour, were deeply affected, but the prisoner himself bore
the news with extraordinary fortitude and composure. His sole comment
upon the intelligence was, that it was "just his blooming luck." By
special favour of the Authorities he is allowed to see the comments
of the Press upon his case, in which he takes the keenest interest.
A statement that he had on one occasion been introduced to the
nursemaid, through whom his career has been so tragically cut short,
has caused him the deepest irritation. He wishes it to be distinctly
understood that both she and her infant charge were absolute strangers
to him.

LATER TELEGRAM.

_Wednesday Morning_.--LARRIKIN continues wonderfully calm. He is
writing his Memoirs, which he has already disposed of to a Newspaper
Syndicate for a handsome consideration. Those who have been privileged
to see the manuscript report that it reveals traces of unsuspected
literary talent, and is marked in places by a genial and genuine
humour. LARRIKIN's great regret is that he will be unable to have
an opportunity of perusing the press-notices and reviews of this his
first essay in authorship, for which he expects a wide popularity.

FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.

_Thursday_.--To-day LARRIKIN received a visit from an old friend, who
was visibly moved during the interview, in spite of the prisoner's
efforts to console him. "There's nothing to snivel about, old man,"
he said repeatedly, with a tranquil smile. He then inquired if it was
true that there were portraits of him in several of the papers, and
was anxious to know if they were like him. He has executed his will,
leaving the copyright of his manuscript, his sole assets, to his
father, who has been in a comparatively humble position of life, but
who will now be raised to a condition of affluence. The father has
been interviewed, and stated to a reporter that he has been much
gratified by the expressions of sympathy which have been showered upon
his son from all sides. This morning a local florist sent LARRIKIN a
beautiful wreath, in which the prisoner's initials and those of his
victims were tastefully intertwined in violets. LARRIKIN was much
touched, and his eyes filled with tears, which, however, he succeeded
in repressing by a strong effort. His self-control and courage are the
admiration of the officials, by whom he will be greatly missed. All
day he has been busy packing up the furniture with which, by special
permission, his little cell has been provided by his many admirers,
and the interior has already lost much of its late dainty and cosy
appearance. LARRIKIN has been whistling a good deal,--though, as the
day wore on, the tunes he executed became of a less lively character.
Towards evening, however, he recovered his ordinary high spirits, and
even danced a "cellar-flap" for the entertainment of his Warders. A
telegram has just been handed to him from an anonymous sender, who is
understood to be a person of some eminence in bird-stuffing circles,
which contained these words--"You are to be hung on my Aunt's
silver-wedding day. Keep your pecker up." On reading this message.
LARRIKIN came more near to breaking down than he has done hitherto.
He has selected the clothes he is to wear on his last semi-public
appearance; they consist of a plain black Angora three-button lounge
coat, a purple velvet waistcoat, soft doeskin trousers, a lay-down
striped collar and dickey, and a light-blue necktie with a glass pin.
He has presented his only other jewellery--an oroide ring, set with
Bristol diamonds--to the Warder who has been most attentive and
devoted to him during his stay in gaol. He is said to have stated
that he freely forgave the infant whose insulting conduct provoked
his outburst, as he did the nursemaid for not restraining her charge's
vivacity. This intimation, at his express desire, will be conveyed
to the parents of the deceased, and will doubtless afford them the
highest consolation.

_Thursday Night, Later_.--LARRIKIN is sleeping peacefully. His
features--refined by the mental anxiety, and the almost monastic
seclusion to which he has been lately subjected--are extremely
pleasing, and even handsome, set-off as they are by the clean collar
which he has put on in anticipation of his approaching doom. Before
sinking into childlike slumber, he listened with evident pleasure to a
banjo which was being played outside a public-house in the vicinity of
the gaol. The banjoist is now being interviewed, and believes that the
air he must have been performing at the time was "_The Lost Chord_."
The scaffold on which the unfortunate LARRIKIN is to expiate his
imprudent act is now being erected, but the workmen's hammers
have been considerately covered with felt to avoid disturbing the
slumberer.

_Friday Morning_, 9 A.M.--All is now over. The prisoner rose early
and made a hearty breakfast, and plainly enjoyed the cigar which he
smoked afterwards with his friend the Governor, who seemed to regard
the entrance of the executioner as an untimely interruption to the
conversation. "You'll have to wait a bit for the rest of that story,
Governor," was LARRIKIN's light-hearted comment. The unhappy man
then--(_Details follow which we prefer to leave to the reader's
imagination--he will find them all in the very next special
description of such a scene_). LARRIKIN was most anxious that it
should be widely known that, in his own words, "he was true to himself
and the public, and game to the last."

Several reporters were present in the prison-yard, and also a number
of persons of distinction, who were only admitted as a great favour.
It is said that the prison Authorities were compelled to disappoint
thousands who had applied for permission to view the last sad scene.

LARRIKIN's melancholy end will doubtless operate as a warning and an
example to many romantic youths, who are only too easily led away by
the morbid desire for notoriety, which is so prevalent nowadays, and
which is so difficult either to account for, or discourage.--(_Special
Descriptive Report_.)

IN OUR GARDEN.

_Monday, November_ 24.

[Illustration]

Charmed to have a visit from OLD MORALITY to-day. Most kind of him to
find time to run down, seeing all he has on hand. But he's a really
good fellow, of the kind who in all circumstances find time to do a
friendly thing. Always from the first taken a friendly interest in our
little experiment. He is, indeed, indirectly personally responsible
for its undertaking. If I hadn't come across him playing leapfrog
before dinner with AKERS--DOUGLAS and JACKSON, as mentioned some weeks
ago, SARK and I would never have tried this way of passing a Recess.

Hadn't heard OLD MORALITY was going to look in. Expect he wasn't sure
he could get away from Cabinet Council, and so didn't write. When I
came upon him he was standing absorbed in contemplation of ARPACHSHAD.
ARPACHSHAD, himself, so engrossed in problem occupying his mind, that
he did not notice our visitor. Had started yesterday cutting grass on
lawn with machine. Getting on pretty well with it till, this morning,
wind rose, blowing half a gale from Westward. ARPACHSHAD discovered
that, starting with machine from the Westward, he, with wind blowing
astern, got on capitally; but coming back, with wind ahead, there was
decided addition to labour of propelling machine. When OLD MORALITY
arrived, ARPACHSHAD had halted midway across the lawn, and was looking
Westward with air of profound and troubled cogitation.

"I know what he's thinking of," said OLD MORALITY, whose Parliamentary
experience has made him an adept at thought-reading; "he's wondering
if it's possible to mow the lawn all from the Westward, so that he
would have the wind behind him throughout the operation."

No doubt OLD MORALITY had fathomed depth of ARPACHSHAD's meditations.
Pretty to see his manoeuvring: Went down full-sail with assistance of
favouring gale; tried to tack back, bearing away to the North; when
he'd got a little way, slewed round to the West, going off before the
wind to edge of lawn. Finally borne in upon him that the position was
inexorable. He couldn't go with the wind all the time; must retrace
his steps; by tacking was really covering more ground than need be;
was, in fact, doing more work than he had intended. Shocked at this
discovery proceeded to follow ordinary course. Presently catching
sight of solitary leaf careering down walk, fetched broom, and
tenderly tickled the gravel in pursuit of the leaf.

"There is," SARK sharply observed, "nothing ARPACHSHAD enjoys more
than dusting the walk with a broom. It is a process that combines the
maximum of appearance of hard work with the minimum of exertion."

OLD MORALITY pretty lively in anticipation of Session, which opens
to-morrow. Always inclined to take sanguine view of situation. Doesn't
vary now. "Oh, you leave it to us, TOBY, dear boy." he said, when I
expressed hope that he would not risk his precious life and health
by overdoing it. "We've got a splendid programme, and mean to pull
through every Bill. Didn't do much last year, it is true: but don't
you see the advantage of that? If we'd passed all our Bills last
Session, must have arranged a new programme this year, involving
considerable labour. As it is we turn a handle, and there are all the
old things once more; homely and friendly; as the poet says, 'All,
all, are come, the old familiar faces.' There's the Irish Local
Government Bill, the Tithes Bill, Employers' Liability, and a troop of
others. All been brought in before; everybody knows about them; if we
don't pass them this Session they must come up again next."

"Ha!" said SARK; "so there is to be a next Session."

"Certainly," said OLD MORALITY--"and we would have another, if we
could. In fact, I'm not quite sure whether it may not be managed. We
are always suspending Standing Orders, of one kind or another. It is a
Standing Order of the Constitution that no Parliament shall sit longer
than seven years. Very good--in an ordinary way, excellent; though,
perhaps, a little too liberal in its arrangements when Mr. G. is
in power. But as you, TOBY, may, in earlier years, diligently
striving after improvement in caligraphy, have had occasion to note,
Circumstances alter Cases. Here we are, a contented Government, with
a Parliamentary majority always to be relied upon. Why disturb an
ordered state of affairs, and plunge the country into the turmoil
and expense of a General Election? Why not bring in a short Bill
to suspend the Septennial Act, and let the present Parliament go on
sitting indefinitely? Why should the Long Parliament remain a monopoly
of the Seventeenth Century? I do not mind telling you (this, of
course, in confidence) that we have talked the matter over in the
Cabinet. It was the MARKISS who first started it; and, though one or
two objections have been raised, the idea is rather growing upon us,
and I should not wonder if it came to something. You will find no
mention of it in the Queen's Speech--but that is neither there nor
here."

"I have noticed," said SARK, "that of late it has happened that Bills
mentioned in the Queen's Speech come to nothing, whilst the Session is
largely taken up with discussion of Bills which find no place in that
catalogue. Last year, for example, JOKIM's Compensation Bill wasn't
mentioned in the Queen's Speech; and yet it filled a large part in the
programme of the Session."

"Ah," said OLD MORALITY, changing the subject, "I see ARPACHSHAD has
nearly come up with that leaf. He'll be going to his dinner now,
I suppose, and I think I must be off. Shall see you at the House
to-morrow. Sorry for you to break up the associations of your rural
life; but that only temporary."

Saw OLD MORALITY off at the station. Came back to pack up our spade
and hoe, and leave some general instructions with ARPACHSHAD. He seems
much touched at the approaching separation. Quite unable to continue
the lawn-mowing. Followed us about with his jack-knife open, clipping
here and there a dead stem, so as to keep up an appearance of
incessant labour.

"Ours is only a change of occupation, ARPACHSHAD," said SARK. "We
cease to labour here, but we carry on our work in another field. We
go to town, leaving, as the Poet GRAY might have said, the garden to
solitude and you."

"Excuse _me_, Gents," said ARPACHSHAD. a look of anxiety crossing his
mobile face, "but you can't leave it to me altogether. I could manage
well enough when you were here, helpin' and workin'. But, when you're
gone, I'll have to have at least one extry man." SARK pleased at
this testimony to value of our assistance; but it really means that
ARPACHSHAD intends to do less than ever, running us into the expense
of a second gardener.

PARS ABOUT PICTURES.

Arrive at Fine Art Society's Place, and there look at HOKUSAI's
drawings and engravings. Who was HOKUSAI? Why, don't you know? He was
our own LIKA-JOKO's great-grandfather. "Great-grandfather was a most
wonderful man, There's none of 'em does what great-grandfather can,"
except LIKA JOKO, of course. Obliged to say this, because I know LIKA
JOKO goes about with a Daimio's two-handed sword, and he would think
nothing of giving me the cut direct. But to return to HOKUSAI--sounds
like sneezing in a Dutch dialect, doesn't it?--his drawings are full
of originality and humour; he was possessed of wondrous versatility
and great industry. He began to draw at six, and continued till he
was well-nigh ninety. Were he flourishing now, he might illustrate the
lucubrations of

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
