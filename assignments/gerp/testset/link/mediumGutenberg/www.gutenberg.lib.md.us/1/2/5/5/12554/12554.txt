PREFACE.


Here we are with our Nineteenth Volume complete. We do not carry it to
Court to gain patronage, neither do we preface it with a costly dedication
to a purse-proud patron; but we present it at the levee of the people, as
a production in which the information and amusement of one and all are
equally kept in view. We know that instances have occurred of authors
tiring out their patrons. A pleasant story is told of Spencer, who sent
the manuscript of his Faery Queen to the Earl of Southampton, the Mecaenas
of those days; when the earl reading a few pages, ordered the poet to be
paid twenty pounds; reading further, another twenty pounds; and proceeding
still, twenty pounds more; till losing all patience, his lordship cried,
"Go turn that fellow out of the house, for if I read on I shall be ruined."
We have no fear this will be our fate; especially as we strive to effect
all that can be accomplished in our economical form to follow as well as
direct the public taste.

Experience has taught us in the conduct of nineteen volumes of
this Miscellany, that the most effectual method of conveying instruction,
or aiding the progress of knowledge, is by combining it with amusement;
or, in other words by at once aiming at the head and heart.
The world is already too full of precept upon precept; and a smattering
of principles is too often found in the place of practice. How can
this order of things be improved but by setting forth duties as innocent
pleasures, sweetening utility with entertainment, and garnishing fact
with fancy. A man need not study Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations
to become rich, nor seek the glories of nature in artificial Systems.
But the contrary notion has probably given rise to the observation, that,
"what the present generation have gained in head, they have lost in
heart." It should not, however, be so, with the abundance of materials
we have for social improvement.

We hope the reader has recognised the influence of these feelings in the
many illustrations of men, manners, and times, which it has ever been our
object to garner into the pages of THE MIRROR. Hence the traits of
domestic life in all ages, and the tales and traditions of the family
hearth, when pointed with a moral, receive our special attention. In this
department, as well as in the playful fancies of poetry, in embellishing
the softer sympathies of nature,--we have been materially aided by our
Correspondents; to all of whom we proffer our best thanks.

In the present volume, the Public Journals of the day have not been
disregarded; while sterling literature, of the _utile cum dulce_ character,
has been studied; and new books have been consulted, not so much for the
purpose of exposing their defects, as exhibiting their perfections. Art
has contributed its novelties; and the progress of Natural Science has
developed many new beauties appreciable by every reader.

The ENGRAVINGS are somewhat more numerous than usual; in all numbering
sixty-three; and they are accompanied by illustrative letter-press of
concise, but we trust, entertaining character.

In Popular Antiquities we may mention Old Fishmongers' Hall, which has
disappeared since the date of our last volume; the Castles of Pontefract,
Wilton, and Dunheved, with traits of their historic lore; the Lady Chapel,
in Southwark, and its changing history; Brighton about a hundred years
since; the Arbalest, or Cross-bow explained with Cuts; Old Bankside, and
the First Theatres; the venerable Melrose on the Tweed; St. Pancras (Old)
Church; and the castellated palace of the Alhambra, in Spain.

Among the Architectural novelties are the Law Institution, in Chancery
Lane; the Lowther Arcade, in the Strand; Staines New Bridge; and two
scenes of the picturesque wonders of the Colosseum, in the Regent's Park.

In Zoology, the most popular study of the day, there are upwards of a
score of novelties. Among them are a dozen Vignettes from the Zoological
Gardens in the Regent's Park, and in Surrey; and illustrations of Rare
Arctic Birds observed during the last overland expedition to the Polar Sea,
by Captain Sir John Franklin.

In the ensuing volume, we have determined upon enlarging our letter-press
page; whilst a new and handsome type has been cast expressly for this work.
By these improvements, as well as by the renewed vigour of our artists,
and a like zeal on our own part, THE MIRROR will be found still worthy of
its old friends, and attractive to new patrons. Its economy need not be
again enforced, although in this respect, our contemplated alterations
cannot but be received as additional points for the encouragement of a
discerning public.

MEMOIR OF THE RIGHT HON. CHARLES GREY, EARL GREY, K.G.,

FIRST LORD OF HIS MAJESTY'S TREASURY, &c. &c.

       *       *       *       *       *

DE BON VOULOIR SERVIR LE ROI.--_Family Motto._

       *       *       *       *       *

The family of GREY--the Greys of the North, as they are styled
distinctively from the Greys of the South,[1]--is of Saxon origin.[2] They
have held manors in Northumberland from the earliest records to the
present time. The direct founder of the present branch was Baron Grey of
Werke, ennobled by James I. and advanced to the earldom of Tankerville by
William III. which titles became extinct in 1710; and the heiress carried
the estates by marriage to Charles Bennet, Lord Ossulston, who was, in
consequence, created Earl of Tankerville, in 1714.

    [1] Wilton Castle, on the Wye, was for several centuries the
        baronial residence of the Greys of the South, who derived
        from it their first title, and became its owners in the time
        of Edward I.--See _Mirror_, vol. xiv. p. 305.

    [2] The barony of Werke was given to the family of Ros, Barons of
        Hemsley, in Yorkshire, by Henry I. for the service of two
        knights' fees, and was in their possession till 1399; but in
        the next year was found to belong to Sir Thomas Grey, of
        Heton. It gave title of baron in 1622, to Sir William Grey,
        who died in 1674. The village of Werke, and its ruined castle,
        are all that remain of the possessions of the barony; the
        former consisting of a miserable cluster of thatched cottages;
        the latter of mere fragments of ashlar work, near its
        foundations and lines of its moat. The village stands on the
        margin of the Tweed: and the castle is celebrated in the
        border annals. Heton, of which we have just spoken, in Edward
        the First's reign, belonged to William de Heton; and in the
        next reign, to Sir Thomas Grey, captain of Norham Castle. Sir
        John Grey, of Heton, in 1420, was graced with the order of St.
        George, or the Garter; and from him the estate descended to
        the Tankervilles.

The father of Earl Grey was Sir Charles Grey, who entered the army at an
early age, had a command in the American war, and commanded in chief the
military forces in the expeditions against the French West India Islands,
the successful result of which was the annexing of Martinique, St. Lucie,
Guadaloupe, &c. to our empire. He married, in 1762, Elizabeth, daughter of
George Grey, Esq. of Southwick, in Durham, (of a different family,) by
whom he had five sons and two daughters. He was created Lord Grey of
Howick, in 1801; and Viscount Howick, and Earl Grey, in 1806. He died in
the following year, and was succeeded by his son, Charles, second and
present earl.

Mr. Grey was born March 13, 1764, and educated at Eton, in the same class
with the late Mr. Lambton, (father of the present Lord Durham,) Mr.
Whitbread, and others, with whom he afterwards acted in political life. He
was then sent to King's College, Cambridge, where he displayed first-rate
abilities. On his leaving the University, he set out on the tour of Europe,
though only eighteen years of age. In Italy, he was introduced to the late
Duke of Cumberland, in whose household he obtained an appointment. He
returned to England in 1786, and soon after his arrival, was, by the
interest of his family, returned to parliament for the county of
Northumberland, when he joined the Whigs, it has been stated, to the
surprise of his family, whose principles were those of Toryism.

At a subsequent general election, as an expensive contest was expected for
Northumberland, Mr. Grey declined nomination, and was returned to
parliament for Appleby, which borough he represented till his succession
to the peerage. In the House of Commons his great talents soon shone forth;
and, in conjunction with Fox, Sheridan, Lambton, Ponsonby, and others, he
maintained an intrepid opposition to the doctrines of that darling of fame,
Mr. Pitt. Immediately after his entrance into Parliament, his discussion
of the minister's important treaty of commerce, may be said to have
established his reputation, by the force of his eloquence, as well as by
the enlarged views which he seemed to have acquired of commercial
relations; which knowledge is more frequently the result of gradual
experience than of early attainment.

In these stormy times Mr. Grey ranked among the head and front of
contending politics. He was appointed one of the managers of that
magnificent political drama--the impeachment of Warren Hastings, when he
displayed great acumen in that part of the accusation termed the Benares
Charge.

In 1791, we find Mr. Grey taking the lead in a measure, which, in the
language of a great orator (Burke) "shed a lustre on the character and
humanity of the nation." The subject to which we allude, was the
melancholy situation of those who were unable to satisfy the demands of
importunate creditors, and consequently subjected to the operation of a
rigorous code of laws. His observation in moving for a parliamentary
committee to inquire into the present practice and effect of imprisonment
for debt is worthy of quotation: "it was desirable to distinguish the
unfortunate debtor from the knavish one, to place the creditor in that
situation which afforded the fairest and the speediest means of
compensation, and to regulate the jails of this country in such a manner
as to prevent unnecessary hardship and restraint. Whether they considered
the practice of confining for debt men who had no means of discharging
such debt, or, on the contrary, fraudulent debtors, whose creditors by no
process could compel them to pay; these circumstances were alone
sufficient to constitute an inquiry into the state of the laws relating to
debtor and creditor." This motion being acceded to, a committee consisting
of Mr. Grey, Mr. Pitt, Sir John Sinclair, Mr. Vansittart, Mr. Martin, the
Attorney and Solicitor Generals, and other legal gentlemen, was
immediately appointed. The origin of this inquiry is an indicative of the
liberal policy of the statesman as it is of the humanity of the mover.

In 1792, Mr. Grey instituted an inquiry into the conduct of ministers with
regard to the recently threatened hostilities with Russia. His
animadversion upon the vacillating and ruinous measures of government were
characterized by that fearless intrepidity, truth, energy, and eloquence,
which have distinguished his political career. The motion for the inquiry
was lost, though the powerful remarks of the mover drew from Mr. Pitt the
following memorable confession: "All unlimited confidence is
unconstitutional; and I hope the inglorious moment will never arrive, when
this house will abandon the privilege of examining, condemning, and
correcting the abuses in the executive government. It is the dearest
privilege you possess, and should never be relinguished."

During the schisms occasioned in this country by the French revolution, Mr.
Grey enrolled himself in a political society, called the Friends of the
People. He also became a member of the Whig Club, then in the zenith of
its celebrity. His active advocacy of the cause of a reform in parliament
was equal within and without the house of commons. To quote one of his
Lordship's most recent speeches, "In 1786 he had voted for reform. He had
supported Mr. Pitt in his motion for shortening the duration of
parliaments. He had given his best assistance to the measure of reform
introduced by Mr. Flood, before the French revolution; and, on one or two
different occasions, he had originated motions on the subject."[3] One of
these was in 1793, when he presented a petition for reform and a shorter
duration of parliament, from the Society of the Friends of the People: his
motion for a committee was lost by 280 to 41. Another occasion to which
his Lordship alludes, was in 1797, when he proposed, in his plan of
parliamentary reform, to give to the county of York four new members; to
divide each county into two districts, each returning a member.
Copyholders and leaseholders were to have equal rights of voting with
freeholders, as were all householders paying taxes in cities and boroughs;
and parliaments were to be triennial. This motion was, however, negatived
by 149 votes.

    [3] Speech on the second reading of the Reform Bill, in the House
        of Lords, Oct. 4, 1831.

In 1795, Mr. Grey opposed with great firmness, Mr. Pitt's motion for the
adjustment of the Prince of Wales's debts, and moved for the reduction of
the Prince's income. He professed himself ready to support the real
splendour of the royal family "as any slippery sycophant of a court;" but
said he thought there was more true dignity in manifesting a heart alive
to the distresses of millions, than in all those trappings which encumber
royalty without adorning it. He asked whether the legislature should give
an example of encouraging extravagance at a moment when the prevailing
fashion of prodigality among people of fortune was rapidly destroying
their independence, and making them the tools of the court, and the
contempt of the people. He knew the refusal to pay his debts would be a
severe privation to the Prince of Wales; but it would be a just penalty
for the past, a useful lesson for the future, and a proper deference to
the severe pressure and privations endured by the people. Mr. Grey's
amendment was supported by what was then a strong majority--99 to 260; and
the original motion carried: his conduct on this occasion seems never to
have been forgotten by the Prince of Wales, the Regent or the King. It
should here be mentioned, that, with equal justice, Mr. Grey subsequently
defended the rights of His Royal Highness from the shackles proposed to be
laid on him as Regent.

Mr. Grey's opposition to Mr. Pitt's measures continued unabated for many
years, while he remained equally steady in his attachment to Mr. Fox. His
bitter hostility to the union between Ireland and England may be said to
have produced one of his most celebrated speeches. Neither was he dazzled,
nor misled by the splendid talents of Burke, at this time in highest
repute. When Mr. Fox was deserted by Lords Fitzwilliam, Carlisle, and
other alarmists, Mr. Grey unchangingly adhered to him; and when Mr. Fox
and Lord Grenville formed a Whig ministry, in 1806, Mr. Grey, then, by his
father's elevation to the peerage, become Lord Howick, was appointed First
Lord of the Admiralty, and one of the Cabinet Council. He next succeeded
Mr. Fox as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and leader in the House of
Commons. This ministry was ill-formed, and wanted unity of purpose: their
abolition of the Slave Trade was a redeeming measure, in which Lord Howick
bore a conspicuous part; but his lordship's motion for the emancipation of
the Catholics brought about his dismissal from the ministry.

Lord Howick, soon after, by the death of his father, succeeded to the
title of Earl Grey; and by the death of his uncle, Sir Henry Grey, to the
family estate. Ill health, for a time, kept his lordship from public life:
he retired with no place but that of a Governor of the Charter House, and
without pension or sinecure. Upon the resignation of the Duke of Portland,
in 1809, his successor, Mr. Perceval, proposed a coalition with Lords
Grenville and Grey, which was at once rejected by the latter. In the
following year, his lordship "felt it his duty to arraign and to expose
the gross mismanagement of the government, and their repeated and
dangerous misconduct," in Parliament. In the same session, he charged the
lord chancellor (Eldon) with a crime little short of treason, in having
set the great seal, in 1801 and 1804, to commissions for giving the royal
assent to several bills, whilst the King was in a state of mental
infirmity, under medical care, and subject to personal control. The motion
was negatived by a majority of 189 to 64; "but Lord Eldon has not
forgotten the accusation, or forgiven the mover."[4] In 1812, another
attempt was made to bring Lord Grey, with Lord Grenville, into the cabinet;
but this was rejected as promptly as before.

        1831.

Lord Grey again retired to private life. In 1817, his lordship reappeared,
and moved an amendment to the parliamentary address to the throne, urging
rigid economy, retrenchment, and an inquiry into the state of the nation.
In the same year he brought before the House of Lords, the notable
circular of Lord Sidmouth for the prosecution of libels by magistrates.
"It is a singular fact," observes an acute historical writer,[5] "that
Lord Grey, on this occasion, made an able and erudite law argument; which
all the law lords, including Lord Ellenborough, made vain efforts to
refute; and which Lord Ellenborough had the manliness to eulogize;"
notwithstanding which Lord Grey's motion for a copy of the opinion of the
law officers of the crown was negatived.

During the trial of Queen Caroline, the wisdom-tempered zeal of Lord Grey
ranked him amongst the most efficient, as he was the most eloquent, of her
defenders: his lordship, in conjunction with Lord King, also made
successive attempts, by motions, to quash the investigation.

To the administration of the Earl of Liverpool, it need scarcely be added,
Earl Grey was thoroughly hostile: his aversion to the policy of Mr.
Canning was equally decided; and the same independent spirit urged him to
oppose the measures of the Wellington cabinet, except the memorable
measure of Catholic Emancipation, by the proposal of which he had lost
office in the year 1810. His lordship's eloquent efforts in this cause
must be alive in the recollection of the reader.

We are now fast approaching the consummation of one of the grand objects
of his lordship's political life. By the dissolution of the Wellington
cabinet, in 1830, Lord Grey became at the head of the present
administration. His first act was the introduction of the grand measure
for parliamentary reform, which, for sixteen months past, has interested
the whole population of this mighty empire. His lordship's emphatic
expressions, on this occasion, are "familiar as household words." "He made
it a condition on accepting office, that Parliamentary Reform should be
introduced as a government measure. That condition having been assented to
by his most gracious sovereign, by this measure he was prepared to stand
or fall." Gratifying as would be the task, we need not detail the
incidents of the last few months of his lordship's career. Our eulogium
would be poor indeed, while nine-tenths of the journals of our country are
perpetuating his good deeds; while his political integrity has become
exemplary to every cabinet in Europe; and millions are about to burst
forth in "the loud festivity of mirth" to celebrate the virtue of their
popular minister.

Earl Grey married in 1794, Mary Elizabeth Brabazon, daughter of Lord
Ponsonby, by whom his lordship has had a numerous family: the eldest son
and heir apparent being Viscount Howick, born in 1802. In our outline of
Lord Grey's public life, the reader may have observed his Lordship's
fondness for the retirement of the domestic circle. This accords with his
recent declaration in parliament: "he was fond of retirement, and in
domestic life he lived happy in the bosom of his family. Nothing could
have tempted him to embark on these stormy seas--

  Bankrupt of life, but prodigal of ease--

nothing but an overpowering sense of the duty which he owed to his
country." Even apart from political distinction, Earl Grey must be
considered happy indeed; but honoured in public and cherished in private
life, his pre-eminence is proud indeed. Shakspeare tells of the "divinity"
that "doth hedge a king:" yet who would enjoy more than the consciousness
of having been true to his sovereign, his country, and his honour.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
