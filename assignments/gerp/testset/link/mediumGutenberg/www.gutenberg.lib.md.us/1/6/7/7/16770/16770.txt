  'Twas on a frosty Christmas Eve
  When Peggy Deutchland woke
       From her wooden sleep
       On the counter steep
  And to her neighbour spoke,

  "Get up! get up, dear Sarah Jane!
  Now strikes the midnight hour,
       When dolls and toys
       Taste human joys,
  And revel in their power.

[Illustration]

  I long to try my limbs a bit,
  And you must walk with me;
       Our joints are good
       Though made of wood,
  And I pine for liberty.

[Illustration]

  For twelve long months we've lain in here.
  But we don't care a fig;
       When wide awake
       It does not take
  Us long to dance a jig.

[Illustration]

  But who comes here across our path,
  In gay attire bedight?
       A little girl
       With hair in curl,
  And eyes so round and bright.

[Illustration]

  Good evening Miss, how fine you look,
  Beside you I feel bare;
       I must confess
       I need a dress
  If I would look as fair.

[Illustration]

  On that high pole I see a flag
  With colors red and blue;
       Dear Sarah Jane
       'Tis very plain
  A climb you'll have to do.

[Illustration]

  You're young and light--so now be quick
  Dear sister good and kind;
       You look dismayed
       Don't be afraid,
  It's not so hard you'll find.

  Then up the pole with trembling limbs,
  Poor Sarah Jane did mount;
       She dared not lag,
       But seized the flag,
  Ere you could twenty count.

  Big Peggy gazed with deep concern,
  And mouth wide open too;
       Her only care
       That she might wear
  A gown of brilliant hue.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Now Peg' by instinct seemed to know
  Where scissors might be got;
       The "fits" were bad,
       But then she had
  No patterns on the spot.

  Soon where the garments hurried on;
  Sarah looked well in blue;
       Mirror in hand
       She took her stand,
  While Peggy pinned her's through.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Said Peggy--"After work so hard,
  I think a rest we need;
       Let's take a ride
       Seated astride
  Upon this gentle steed."

  Then simple Sarah Jane climbed up
  Upon his wooden back;
       With tim'rous heart
       She felt him start
  Upon the open track.

[Illustration]

  Ere long they knew that hidden there,
  Beneath a stolid mien,
       Dwelt a fierce will.
       They could not still
  They rode as if by steam!

[Illustration]

  Peggy held on with tightening grip,
  While Sarah Jane behind,
       Having no hold
       To make her bold,
  To screaming gave her mind.

  "O Peggy! put me down I pray!
  I ride in mortal dread!
       Do make him stop,
       Or I shall drop
  And break my wooden head!"

  E'en as those piteous words she spoke,
  They struck a fearful "snag"
       Their grips they lost,
       And both were tossed
  Upon the cruel "flag".

[Illustration]

  Their senses for a moment gone,
  They lay in ghastly plight;
       Their fiery steed
       From burden freed,
  Maintained his onward flight.

  Then each in aching consciousness
  Rose slowly with sad groans;
       Next faced about
       With angry shout,
  Followed by tears and moans.

[Illustration]

  Each blamed the other for the fall;
  Until, in gentler mood,
       Their hurts they dress,
       While both confess
  The crying did them good.

  A wooden crutch poor Peggy finds
  To help her on her feet;
       Both solemn-faced
       Their steps retraced
  To where they first did meet.

[Illustration]

  But sorrow's tears are quickly dried
  With dolls as well as men.--
       A jolly crowd
       All laughing loud
  (I think you'll count just ten.)

  Mounted a little wooden cart,
  While Peggy, brave and tried,
       Got up in front
       To bear the brunt
  Of "Hobby's" mighty stride.

[Illustration]

  Finding a pleasant open space,
  Gay Peg' unships her load;
       Suggests a game
       Which, it is plain,
  Will soon be quite the "mode."

  She tells of former Christmas nights,
  When many of her kind,
       At leap-frog played,
       And merry made,
  Fast running like the wind.

  The happy moments swiftly sped
  In unabated glee;
       Their lungs were strong,
       Their legs were long,
  And supple at the knee.

[Illustration]

  But soon they hear the clock strike "two"
  The hours are flying fast!
       With much to do
       Ere night be thro'
  Its' pleasures overpast!

  "Just one leap more!" cries Sarah Jane,
  "This fills my wildest dream!"
       E'en as she spoke,
       Peg' Deutchland broke
  Into a piercing scream.

  Then all look round, as well they may
  To see a horrid sight!
       The blackest gnome
       Stands there alone,
  They scatter in their fright.

  With kindly smile he nearer draws;
  Begs them to feel no fear.
       "What is your name?"
       Cries Sarah Jane;
  "The 'Golliwogg' my dear."

  Their fears allayed--each takes an arm,
  While up and down they walk;
       With sidelong glance
       Each tries her chance,
  And charms him with "small talk".

[Illustration]

  Another wonder now attracts
  The simple Sarah Jane;
       Upon one knee
       She drops with glee,
  In case this box contain

  Some pretty thing to give her joy,
  Some new-discovered treat!
       Old Peg', who planned
       The fun in hand,
  Watches with face discreet.

[Illustration]

  The lock unlatched, the lid springs up,
  Knocks Sarah on her back,
       With flying hair
       And trying stare,
  Out of the box springs "Jack".

  Our naughty Peg' enjoys the scene,
  Laughs lung with fiendish glee;
       Next takes to flight,
       Gets out of sight,
  Fresh tricks to plan you'll see.

[Illustration]

  Soon Sarah's heart new courage takes,
  She hits upon a plan;
       Makes up her mind
       To run behind
  And kill the staring man!

  Attempts are vain, he will not die!
  In terror Sarah flees;
       Meets a new toy
       Called "Scissors Boy",
  And begs him just to please.

[Illustration]

  To help her pay bad Peggy back
  For her malicious tricks;
       Nor does she see
       That even he
  Enjoys her woeful "fix".

  Peg's pious face and peaceful pose
  You'd think portended fair,
       When like a flash
       She makes a dash,
  Sends Sarah high in air!

[Illustration]

  Entangled in the "Scissors Boy",
  Alas! death seems quite near;
       Her trust betrayed,
       This hapless maid
  Sobs out her grief and fear.

  'Twas Peggy's fault the whole way through;
  The boy had meant no harm.
       Both ran away,
       Nor thought to stay
  Poor Sarah's fright to calm.

[Illustration]

  A handsome soldier passing by,
  His heart quite free from guile,
       With martial air
       And manner rare
  Soon helped the girl to smile.

  He said the Ball would now begin
  And begged her for a dance;
       She bowed so low,
       It looked as tho'
  Her style had come from France.

[Illustration]

  A lively waltz the couple take,
  While all admire their grace,
       As round and round
       Upon the ground
  They spin with quickened pace.

  And shameless Peg' sits on a chair
  A true "flower of the wall"
       While Sarah Jane,
       Tis very plain,
  Need never rest at all.

[Illustration]

  With graceful compliment the Clown
  Bows low before the belle,
       Whose modest face,
       And simple grace,
  In starry robe looked well.

  "I know I'm but a stupid Clown,
  And play a clumsy role;
       Yet underneath
       This painted sheath
  I wear an ardent Soul."

[Illustration]

  Just then a jovial African
  With large admiring eyes,
       Seizes her hand
       Just as the band
  To give them a surprise

  Strikes up the "Barn-dance"; like a flash
  Both spring into their place!
       Away they go
       First quick, then slow,
  Each movement fraught with grace.

[Illustration]

  The jolly pair then pause to watch
  A "Magnate" from Japan,
       Who quite alone
       So far from home
  (Poor harmless little man)

  Dances a curious Eastern dance
  To many a jingling bell;
       His brilliant dress,
       They both confess,
  Becomes him very well.

[Illustration]

  And now the Ball is at its height,
  A madly whirling throng;
       Each merry pair
       A smile doth wear.
  And Sambo sings a song.

  While in their midst the artist head
  Of "Golliwogg" appears,
       With Peg beside,
       Whose graceful stride
  No criticism fears.

[Illustration]

  But even wooden limbs get tired
  And want a chance of play,
       So "Golliwogg"
       A "jolly dog"
  Suggests they run away.

  The big shop door is bolted fast,
  But through the yard behind,
       Peggy has spied
       One open wide,
  Which she will shortly find.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  A touch--A push--and out they fly
  Into the starlight night;
       No one must know
       The way they go
  They cover up their flight.

  And though their laughing faces tell
  How they enjoy the fun,
       No sound they make,
       But quickly take
  Unto their heels and run.

[Illustration]

  Nor stop until they reach a field,
  And find a lovely slide;
       No fear has Peg,
       But Meg and Weg
  Cling screaming as they glide.

  The "Golliwogg" with flying hair,
  Takes the first lead you see,
       Nor minds at all
       The "Midget" small,
  Her arms outstretched in glee.

[Illustration]

  The sliders never dreamed of harm,
  They sailed like ships at sea;
       'Twas Meg and Weg,
       Who Tripped up Peg,
  And brought to grief their spree.

  The wrong man often gets the blame
  'Twas just so in this case,
       And balls of snow
       They madly throw
  At "Golliwogg's" kind face.

[Illustration]

  He catches one in either eye,
  And then turns tail to run;
       The steady aim
       Of Sarah Jane
  Grows very serious fun.

  He does not like the way girls act,
  For five to one's not fair;
       There's no escape
       One hits his nape,
  Another strikes his hair.

[Illustration]

  "Vengeance!" he cries, "I'll pay them out!
  If girls will play with boys,
       There's got be
       Equality,
  So here's for equipoise!"

  And then some monster balls he makes,
  He does not spare the snow
       And as each back
       Receives a whack,
  Like ninepins down they go.

  In life we have our "ups" and "downs",
  These dolls enjoyed the same;
       Though down went Weg,
       Don't think, I beg,
  'Twas due to Sarah Jane.

  You see the sled was pretty full,
  The hill was rather steep;
       Weg was to steer
       But in her fear
  She took a backward leap.

[Illustration]

  Anon all reached the valley safe,
  And skating longed to try;
       The ice seemed good,
       As each one stood
  Upon the bank hard by.

  While "Golliwogg" with cautious steps,
  Toward the middle skates;
       They hear a crack!
       They cry, "come back
  To your devoted mates!"

[Illustration]

  Too late! alas their call is vain!
  He swiftly disappears!
       His kind forethought
       Is dearly bought,
  It melts them unto tears.

  But sturdy Peg is quick to act,
  She gives an order clear,
       "Creep on your knees,
       And by degrees
  We to the hole will steer."

[Illustration]

  They reach in time, Peg drags him out
  With all her might and main;
       Poor "Golliwogg",
       A dripping log,
  Must be got home again.

  Behold sure signs of early dawn,
  As down the field they start;
       A leaden weight,
       This living freight,
  With faintly beating heart.

[Illustration]

  In half an hour the sun comes up,
  And shows a merry face;
       He winks an eye
       As passing by
  He sees the skating place.

  And when he peeps into the shop
  With jolly laughing eye,
       Tho' he's not blind
       He cannot find
  A single toy awry!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
