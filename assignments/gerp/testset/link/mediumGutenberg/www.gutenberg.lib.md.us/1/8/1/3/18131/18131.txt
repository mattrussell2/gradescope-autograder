_PUBLISHERS' NOTE_


The Princess Winsome, the part taken by the "Little Colonel" in the play
called "The Rescue of Princess Winsome" in "The Little Colonel's Hero,"
has shared the popularity of the creator of the role.

Appealing to children because of its association with their favorite
heroine, and to their parents because of its high moral tone and the
beauty of its lines, the play has found great favor among children's
clubs for their private theatricals, in many cases rivalling the success
of the "Little Colonel" and her friends in obtaining funds for
charitable purposes.

In response to repeated requests, the publishers are glad to present the
play in separate form, making it more easily accessible to young amateur
actors and actresses.

"_THE RESCUE OF THE PRINCESS WINSOME_"


ACT I.

SCENE I. _Witch bends over fire in middle of orchard, brewing a charm in
her caldron. Ogre stalks in, grinning frightfully, swinging his bludgeon
in triumph_.


_Ogre_

  Ha, old witch, it is done at last!
  I have broken the King's stronghold!
  I have stolen away his children twain
  From the clutch of their guardsmen bold.
  I have dragged them here to my castle tower.
  Prince Hero is strong and fair.
  But he and his sister shall rue my power,
  When once up yon winding stair.


_Witch_

  Now why didst thou plot such a wicked thing?
  The children no harm have done.


_Ogre_

  But I have a grudge 'gainst their father, the King,
  A grudge that is old as the sun.
  And hark ye, old hag, I must have thy aid
  Before the new moon be risen.
  Now brew me a charm in thy caldron black,
  That shall keep them fast in their prison!


_Witch_

  I'll brew thee no charm, thou Ogre dread!
  Knowest thou not full well
  The Princess thou hast stolen away
  Is guarded by Fairy spell?
  Her godmother over her cradle bent.
  "O Princess Winsome," she said,
  "I give thee this gift: thou shalt deftly spin,
  As thou wishest, Love's golden thread."
  So I dare not brew thee a spell 'gainst her.
  My caldron would grow acold
  And never again would bubble up,
  If touched by her thread of gold.


_Ogre_

  Then give me a charm to bind the prince.
  Thou canst do that much at least.
  I'll give thee more gold than hands can hold,
  If thou'lt change him into some beast.


_Witch_

  I have need of gold--so on the fire
  I'll pile my fagots higher and higher,
  And in the bubbling water stir
  This hank of hair, this patch of fur
  This feather and this flapping fin,
  This claw, this bone, this dried snake skin!
      Bubble and boil
      And snake skin coil,
      This charm shall all plans
      But the Ogre's foil.


[_As Witch stirs and sings, the Ogre, stalking to the side, calls._


_Ogre_

  Ho, Frog-eye Fearsome, let the sport begin!
  Hence to the tower! Drag the captives in!


[_Frog-eye Fearsome drags Prince Hero and Princess Winsome across the
stage, and into the door leading up the tower stair. They are bound by
ropes. Prince tries to reach his sword. Princess shrieks._


_Princess_

  Oh, save us, good, wise witch,
  In pity, save us, pray.
  The King, our royal father,
  Thy goodness will repay.


[_Pulls back, wringing hand._


  Oh, I cannot, _cannot_ mount the tower!
  Oh, save us from the bloody Ogre's power!


[_They are dragged into the tower, door bangs and Ogre locks it with
key a yard long. Goes back to Witch, who hands him vial filled from
caldron with black mixture._


_Witch_

  Pour drop by drop upon Prince Hero's tongue.
  First he will bark.  His hands and feet
  Will turn to paws, and he will seem a dog.
  Seven drops will make the change complete.
  The poison has no antidote save one,
  And he a prince again can never be,
  Unless seven silver plums he eats,
  Plucked from my golden apple-tree.


_Ogre_

  Revenge is sweet,
  And soon 'twill be complete!
  Then to my den I'll haste for gold to delve.
  I'll bring it at the black, bleak hour of twelve!


_Witch_

  And I upon my broomstick now must fly
  To woodland tryst. Come, Horned Owl
  And Venomed Toad! Now play the spy!
  Let no one through my orchard prowl.


[_Exit Witch and Ogre to dirge music._



SCENE II. _Enter King and Queen weeping. They pace up and down, wringing
hands, and showing great signs of grief. Godmother enters from opposite
side. King speaks._


_King_

  Good dame, Godmother of our daughter dear,
  Perhaps thou'st heard our tale of woe.
  Our children twain are stolen away
  By Ogre Grim, mine ancient foe.

  All up and down the land we've sought
  For help to break into his tower.
  And now, our searching all for nought,
  We've come to beg the Witch's power.


[_Godmother springs forward, finger to lip, and anxiously waves them
away from orchard._


_Godmother_

  Nay! Nay! Your Majesty, go not
  Within that orchard, now I pray!
  The Witch and Ogre are in league.
  They've wrought you fearful harm this day.
  She brewed a draught to change the prince
  Into a dog! Oh, woe is me!
  I passed the tower and heard him bark:
  Alack! That I must tell it thee!


[_Queen shrieks and falls back in the King's arms, then recovering
falls to wailing._


_Queen_

  My noble son a _dog_? A _beast_?
  It cannot, must not, _shall_ not be!
  I'll brave the Ogre in his den,
  And plead upon my bended knee!


_Godmother_

  Thou couldst not touch his heart of stone.
  He'd keep _thee_ captive in his lair.
  The Princess Winsome can alone
  Remove the cause of thy despair.
  And I unto the tower will climb,
  And ere is gone the sunset's red,
  Shall bid her spin a counter charm--
  A skein of Love's own Golden Thread.
  Take heart, O mother Queen! Be brave!
  Take heart, O gracious King, I pray!
  Well can she spin Love's Golden Thread,
  And Love can _always_ find a way!


[_Exit Godmother._


_Queen_

  She's gone, good dame. But what if she
  Has made mistake, and thread of gold
  Is not enough to draw our son
  From out the Ogre's cruel hold?
  Canst think of nought, your Majesty?
  Of nothing else? Must we stand here
  And powerless lift no hand to speed
  The rescue of our children dear?


[_King clasps hand to his head in thought, then starts forward._


_King_

  I have it now! This hour I'll send
  Swift heralds through my wide domains,
  To say the knight who rescues them
  Shall wed the Princess for his pains.


_Queen_


  Quick! Let us fly! I hear the sound of feet,
  As if some horseman were approaching nigher.
  'Twould not be seemly should he meet
  Our royal selves so near the Witch's fire.


[_They start to run, but are met by Knight on horseback in centre of
stage. He dismounts and drops to one knee._


_King_

  Tis Feal the Faithful! Rise, Sir Knight,
  And tell us what thou doest here!


_Knight_

  O Sire, I know your children's plight.
  I go to ease your royal fear.


_Queen_

  Now if thou bringst them back to us,
  A thousand blessings on thy head.


_King_

  Ay, half my kingdom shall be thine.
  The Princess Winsome thou shalt wed.


_Queen_

  But tell us, how dost thou think to cope
  With the Ogre so dread and grim?
  What is the charm that bids thee hope
  Thou canst rout and vanquish him?


_Knight_

  My faithful heart is my only charm,
  But my good broadsword is keen,
  And love for the princess nerves my arm
  With the strength of ten, I ween.
  Come weal, come woe, no knight can fail
  Who goes at Love's behest.
  Long ere one moon shall wax and wane,
  I shall be back from my quest.
  I have only to find the South Wind's flute.
  In the Land of Summer it lies.
  It can awaken the echoes mute,
  With answering replies.
  And it can summon the fairy folk
  Who never have said me nay.
  They'll come to my aid at the flute's clear call.
  Love _always_ can find a way.


_King_

  Go, Feal the Faithful. It is well!
  Successful mayst thou be,
  And all the way that thou dost ride,
  Our blessings follow thee.

[_Curtain._




ACT II.


SCENE. _Room in Ogre's tower. Princess Winsome kneeling with arm
around Dog's neck._


_Princess_

  _Art_ thou my brother? Can it be
  That thou hast taken such shape?
  Oh turn those sad eyes not on me!
  There _must_ be some escape.
  And yet our parents think us dead.
  No doubt they weep this very hour,
  For no one ever has escaped,
  Ere this, the Ogre's power.
  Oh cruel fate! We can but die!
  Each moment seems a week.
  _Is_ there no hope? Oh, Hero dear,
  If thou couldst only speak!
  But no! Within this tower room
  We're captive, and despair
  Must settle on us. 'Tis the doom
  Of all dragged up yon winding stair.


[_Drops her head and weeps. Enter Godmother, who waves wand and
throwing back curtain, displays a spinning-wheel._


_Godmother_

  Rise, Princess Winsome,
  Dry your weeping eyes.
  The way of escape
  Within your own hand lies.

  Waste no time in sorrow,
  Spin and sing instead.
  Spin for thy brother's sake,
  A skein of golden thread.

  Question not the future,
  Mourn not the past,
  But keep thy wheel a-turning,
  Spinning well and fast.

  All the world helps gladly
  Those who help themselves,
  And the thread thou spinnest,
  Shall be woven by elves.

  All good things shall speed thee!
  Thy knight, the Faithful Feal,
  Is to thy rescue riding.
  Up! To thy spinning-wheel!


[_Disappears behind curtain._


_Princess_

  All good things shall speed me?
  Sir Knight, the Faithful Feal,
  Is to my rescue riding?


[_In joyful surprise._


  Turn, turn, my spinning-wheel!


(_She sings._)



_Spinning Wheel Song_


[Illustration: Spinning Wheel Song]


1. My godmother bids me spin,
   that my heart may not be sad.
   Spin and sing for my brother's sake,
   and the spinning makes me glad.

2. Spin, sing with humming whir,
   the wheel goes round and round.
   For my brother's sake, the charm I'll break,
   Prince Hero shall be found.

   Spin, sing, the golden thread,
   Gleams in the sun's bright ray,
   The humming wheel my grief can heal,
   For love will find a way.


[_Pauses with uplifted hand._


  What's that at my casement tapping?
  Some messenger, maybe.
  Pause, good wheel, in thy turning,
  While I look out and see.


[_Opens casement and leans out, as if welcoming a carrier dove, which
may be concealed in basket outside window._


  Little white dove, from my faithful knight,
  Dost thou bring a message to me?
  Little white dove with the white, white breast,
  What may that message be?


[_Finds note, tied to wing._


  Here is his letter. Ah, well-a-day!
  I'll open it now, and read.
  Little carrier dove, with fluttering heart,
  I'm a happy maiden, indeed.
  (_She reads._) "O Princess fair, in the Ogre's tower,
  In the far-off Summer-land
  I seek the South Wind's silver flute,
  To summon a fairy band.
  Now send me a token by the dove
  That thou hast read my note.
  Send me the little heart of gold
  From the chain about thy throat.
  And I shall bind it upon my shield,
  My talisman there to stay.
  And then all foes to me must yield,
  For Love will find the way.

  Here is set the hand and seal
  Of thy own true knight, the faithful--Feal."


[_Princess takes locket from throat and winds chain around dove's neck._

_Princess sings_



_The Dove Song_


[Illustration: The Dove Song]

   Now, flutter and fly, flutter and fly,
   Bear him my heart of gold,
   Bid him be brave little carrier dove!
   Bid him be brave and bold!

   Tell him that I at my spinning wheel,
   Will sing while it turns and hums,
   And think all day of his love so leal,
   Until with the flute he comes.

   Now fly, flutter and fly,
   Now flutter and fly away, away.


[_Sets dove at liberty. Turning to wheel again, repeats song._


_Princess repeats_

  My Godmother bids me spin,
  That my heart may not be sad;
  Spin and sing for my brother's sake,
  And the spinning makes me glad.

  Sing! Spin! With hum and whir
  The wheel goes round and round.
  For my brother's sake the charm I'll break!
  Prince Hero shall be found.

  Spin! Sing! The golden thread
  Gleams in the sunlight's ray!
  The humming wheel my grief can heal,
  For Love will find a way.


[_First messenger appears at window, dressed as a Morning-glory._


_Morning-glory_

  Fair Princess,
  This morning, when the early dawn
  Was flushing all the sky,
  Beside the trellis where I bloomed,
  A knight rode slowly by.

  He stopped and plucked me from my stem,
  And said, "Sweet Morning-glory,
  Be thou my messenger to-day,
  And carry back my story.

  "Go bid the Princess in the tower
  Forget all thought of sorrow.
  Her true knight will return to her
  With joy, on some glad morrow."


[_Disappears._


_Princess sings_

  Spin! spin! The golden thread
  Holds no thought of sorrow.
  My true knight he shall come to me
  With joy on some glad morrow.


[_Second flower messenger, dressed as Pansy, appears at window._


_Pansy_

  Gracious Princess,
  I come from Feal the Faithful.
  He plucked me from my bower,
  And said, speed to the Princess
  And say, "Like this sweet flower
  The thoughts within my bosom
  Bloom ever, love, of thee.
  Oh, read the pansy's message,
  And give a thought to me."


[_Pansy disappears._


_Princess sings_

  Spin, spin, O golden thread!
  And turn, O humming wheel.
  This pansy is his thought of me,
  My true knight, brave and leal.


[_Third flower messenger, a pink Rose._


_Rose_

  Thy true knight battled for thee to-day,
  On a fierce and bloody field,
  But he won at last in the hot affray,
  By the heart of gold on his shield.

  He saw me blushing beside a wall,
  My petals pink in the sun
  With pleasure, because such a valiant knight
  The hard-fought battle had won.

  And he kissed me once on my soft pink cheek,
  And once in my heart of gold,
  And bade me hasten to thee and speak.
  Pray take the message I hold.


[_Princess goes to the window, takes a pink rose from the messenger.
As she walks back, kisses it and fastens it on her dress. Then turns to
wheel again._


_Princess sings_

  Spin, spin, O golden thread,
  And turn, O happy wheel.
  The pink rose brought in its heart of gold
  A kiss, his love to seal.


[_Fourth messenger, a Forget-me-not._


_Forget-me-not_

  Fair Princess,
  Down by the brook, when the sun was low,
  A brave knight paused to slake
  His thirst in the water's silver flow,
  As he journeyed far for thy sake.

  He saw me bending above the stream,
  And he said, "Oh, happy spot!
  Ye show me the Princess Winsome's eyes
  In each blue forget-me-not."
  He bade me bring you my name to hide
  In your heart of hearts for ever,
  And say as long as its blooms are blue,
  No power true hearts can sever.


_Princess sings_

  Spin, spin, O golden thread.
  O wheel, my happy lot
  It is to hide within my heart
  That name, forget-me-not.


[_Fifth messenger, a Poppy._


_Poppy_

  Dear Princess Winsome,
  Within the shade of a forest glade
  He laid him down to sleep,
  And I, the Poppy, kept faithful guard
  That it might be sweet and deep.
  But oft in his dreams he stirred and spoke,
  And thy name was on his tongue,
  And I learned his secret ere he woke,
  When the fair new day was young.
  And this is what he, whispering, said,
  As he journeyed on in his way:
  "Bear her my dreams in your chalice red,
  For I dream of her night and day."


_Princess sings_

  Spin, spin, O golden thread.
  He dreams of me night and day!
  The poppy's chalice is sweet and red.
  Oh, Love will find a way!


[_Sixth messenger, a Daisy_.


_Daisy_

  O Princess fair,
  Far on the edge of the Summer-land
  I stood with my face to the sun,
  And the brave knight counted with strong hand
  My petals, one by one.

  And he said, "O Daisy, white and gold,
  The princess must count them too.
  By thy petals shall she be told
  If my long, far quest is through.

  "Whether or not her knight has found
  The South Wind's flute that he sought."
  So over the hills from the Summer-land,
  Your true knight's token I've brought.


[_Gives Princess a large artificial daisy. She counts petals, slowly
dropping them one by one_.


_Princess_

  Far on the edge of the Summer-land,
  O Daisy, white and gold,
  My true love held you in his hand.
  What was the word he told?

  He's found it. Found it not.
  Found it. Found it not.

  That magic flute of the South Wind, sweet,
  Will he blow it, over the lea?
  Will the fairy folk its call repeat,
  And hasten to rescue me?

  He's found it, found it not.
  Found it, found it not.
  Found it, found it not.
  He's _found_ it!

[_Turning to the dog._

  Come, Hero! Hear me, brother mine;
  Thy gladness must indeed be mute,
  But oh, the joy! We're saved! We're saved!
  My knight has found the silver flute!


(_Sings_.)



"_Spin, Wheel, Reel Out Thy Golden Thread_"


[Illustration: Spin, Wheel, Reel Out Thy Golden Thread]

   Spin, wheel, reel out thy golden thread,
   My happy heart sings glad and gay,...
   Hero  shall 'scape the Ogre dread,
   And I my own true love shall wed,
   For love has found a way,
   For love has found a way.


[_Curtain._




ACT III.


SCENE. _In front of Witch's Orchard. Knight comes riding by, blows flute
softly under the tower window. Princess leans out and waves her hand.
Knight dismounts, and little page takes horse, leading it off stage._


_Knight_

  Lean out of thy window, O Princess fair,
  Rescuers now are at hand.
  Thou shalt be led down the winding stair
  By the Queen of the Fairy band.

  Listen, as low on the South Wind's flute
  I call the elves to our tryst.
  Down rainbow bubbles they softly float,
  Light-winged as stars in a mist.


[_He blows a flute, and from every direction the Fairies come floating
in, their gauzy wings spangled, and each one carrying a toy balloon,
attached to a string. They trip back and forth, their balloons bobbing
up and down like rainbow bubbles, singing._



_Fairy Chorus_


[Illustration: Fairy Chorus]


   We come, we come at thy call,
   On rainbow bubbles we float.
   We fairies, one and all,
   Have answer'd the wind flute's note.

1. The south wind's silver flute,
   From the far-off summer land,
   It bade us hasten here,
   To lend a helping hand.
   It bade us hasten, hasten here,
   To lend a helping hand.

2. To the aid of the gallant knight,
   To the help of the princess fair,
   To the rescue of the prince,
   We come to the Ogre's lair.
   To the rescue of the prince,
   We come to the Ogre's lair.

3. And now, at thy behest,
   We pause in our bright array,
   To end thy weary  quest,
   For love has found a way,
   To end thy weary, weary quest,
   For love has found a way.


[_Queen Titania coming forward, waves her star-tipped-wand, and looks
up toward Princess at the window._


_Titania_

  Princess Winsome,
  When thy good Godmother
  Bade thee spin Love's thread,
  It was with this promise,
  These the words she said:

  All the world helps gladly
  Those who help themselves.
  The thread thou spinnest bravely,
  Shall be woven by elves.

  And now, O Princess Winsome,
  How much hast thou spun,
  As thy wheel, a-whirling,
  Turned from sun to sun?


_Princess_

  This, O Queen Titania.

[_Holding up mammoth ball._

  To the humming wheel's refrain,
  I sang, and spun the measure
  Of one great golden skein.

  And winding, winding, winding,
  At last I wound it all,
  Until the thread all golden
  Made a mammoth wonder-ball.


_Titania_

  Here below thy casement
  Thy true knight waiting stands.
  Drop the ball thou holdest
  Into his faithful hands.


[_Princess drops the ball, Knight catches it, and as Titania waves her
wand, he starts along the line of Fairies. They each take hold as the
Witch and Ogre come darting in, she brandishing her broomstick, he his
bludgeon. They come through gate of the Orchard in the background. As
the ball unwinds, the Fairies march around them, tangling them in the
yards and yards of narrow yellow ribbon, singing as they go._


_Fairy Chorus_

  We come, we come at thy call,
  On rainbow bubbles we float.
  We fairies, one and all,
  Have answered the Wind-flute's note.
  To the aid of the gallant Knight,
  To the help of the Princess fair,
  To the rescue of the Prince,
  We come to the Ogre's lair.

  We come, we come at thy call,
  The Witch and Ogre to quell,
  And now they both must bow
  To the might of the fairies' spell.
  Love's Golden Thread can bind
  The strongest Ogre's arm,
  And the spell of the blackest Witch
  Must yield to its mighty charm.


[_Ogre and Witch stand bound and helpless, tangled in golden cord.
They glower around with frightful grimaces. King and Queen enter
unnoticed from side. Knight draws his sword, and brandishing it before
Ogre, cries out fiercely._


_Knight_

  The Key! The key that opens yonder tower!
  Now give it me, or by my troth
  Your head shall from your shoulders fly!
  To stab you through I'm nothing loath!


[_Ogre gives Knight the key. He rushes to the door, unlocks it, and
Princess and dog burst out. Queen rushes forward and embraces her, then
the King, and Knight kneels and kisses her hand. Princess turns to
Titania._


_Princess_

  Oh, happy day that sets me free
  From yon dread Ogre's prison!
  Oh, happy world, since 'tis for me
  Such rescuers have 'risen.
  But see, your Majesty! the plight
  Of Hero--he the Prince, my brother!
  Wilt thou _his_ wrong not set aright?
  Another favour grant! One other!


[_Titania waves wand toward Knight who springs at Witch with drawn sword_.


_Knight_

  The spell! The spell that breaks the power
  That holds Prince Hero in its thrall!
  Now give it me, or in this hour
  Thy head shall from its shoulders fall!


_Witch_

  Pluck with your thumbs
  Seven silver plums

[_Speaking in high, cracked voice_.

  From my golden apple-tree!
  These the dog must eat.
  The change will be complete,
  And a prince once more the dog will be!


[_Princess darts back into orchard, followed by dog, who crouches
behind hedge, and is seen no more. She picks plums, and, stooping, gives
them to him, under cover of the hedge. The real Prince Hero leaps up
from the place where he has been lying, waiting, and hand in hand they
run back to the centre of the stage, where the Prince receives the
embraces of King and Queen. Prince then turns to Knight_.


_Prince Hero_

  Hail, Feal the Faithful!
  My gratitude I cannot tell,
  That thou at last hast freed me
  From the Witch's fearful spell.
  But wheresoe'er thou goest,
  Thou faithful knight and true,
  The favours of my kingdom
  Shall all be showered on you.


[_Turns to Titania._


  Hail, starry-winged Titania!
  And ye fairies, rainbow-hued!
  I have not words sufficient
  To tell my gratitude,
  But if the loyal service
  Of a mortal ye should need,
  Prince Hero lives to serve you,
  No matter what the deed!


[_Characters now group themselves in tableau. Queen and Prince on one
side. Godmother and Titania on the other. King in centre, with Princess
on one hand, Knight on other. He places her hand in the Knight's, who
kneels to receive it. Ogre and Witch, still making horrible faces, are
slightly in background, bound. Fairies form an outer semi-circle_.


_King_

  And now, brave Knight, requited stand!
  Here is the Princess Winsome's hand.
  To-morrow thou shalt wedded be,
  And half my kingdom is for thee!


_Fairy Chorus_

  Love's golden cord has bound
  The strongest Ogre's arm,
  And the spell of the blackest Witch
  Has yielded to its charm.
  The Princess Winsome plights
  Her troth to the Knight to-day,
  So fairies, one and all,
  We need no longer stay.

  The golden thread is spun,
  The Knight has won his bride,
  And now our task is done,
  We may no longer bide.
  On rainbow bubbles bright,
  We fairies float away.
  _The wrong is now set right_
  _And Love has found the way!_



_Curtain._

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
