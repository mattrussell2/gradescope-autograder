IN MEMORY
OF THE ONES THAT GREW
SO LONG AGO,
IN OLD "Aunt Nancy's" GARDEN.




The Legend of the Bleeding-heart




In days of old, when all things in the Wood had speech, there lived
within its depths a lone Flax-spinner. She was a bent old creature, and
ill to look upon, but all the tongues of all the forest leaves were ever
kept a-wagging with the story of her kindly deeds. And even to this day
they sometimes whisper low among themselves (because they fain would
hold in mind so sweet a tale) the story of her kindness to the little
orphan, Olga.

'Twas no slight task the old Flax-spinner took upon herself, the day she
brought the helpless child to share the shelter of her thatch. The Oak
outside her door held up his arms in solemn protest.

"Thou dost but waste thyself," he said. "Thy benefits will be forgot,
thy labours unrequited. For Youth is ever but another title for
Ingratitude."

"Nay, friend," the old Flax-spinner said. "My little Olga will not be
ungrateful and forgetful."

All hedged about with loving care, the orphan grew to gracious
maidenhood, and felt no lack of father, mother, brother or sister. In
every way the old Flax-spinner took their places. But many were the
sacrifices that she made to keep her fed and warmly clad, and every time
she went without herself that Olga might receive a greater share,
Wiseacre Oak looked down and frowned and shook his head.

Then would the old dame hasten to her inner room, and there she pricked
herself with her spindle, until a great red drop of her heart's blood
fell into her trembling hand. With witchery of words she blew upon it,
and rolled it in her palm, and muttering, turned and turned and turned
it. And as the spell was laid upon it, it shrivelled into a tiny round
ball like a seed, and she strung it on a thread where were many others
like it, saying, "By this she will remember. She will not be ungrateful
and forgetful."

So years went by, and Olga grew in goodness and in beauty, and helped
the old Flax-spinner in her tasks as blithely and as willingly as if
she were indeed her daughter. Every morning she brought water from the
spring, gathered the wild fruits of the woods, and spread the linen on
the grass to bleach. At such times would the bent old foster-mother hold
herself erect, and call up to the Oak, "Dost see? Thou'rt wrong! Youth
is _not_ another title for Ingratitude."

"Thou hast not lived as long as I," would be the only answer.

One day as Olga was wandering by the spring, searching for watercresses,
the young Prince of the castle rode by on his prancing charger. A
snow-white plume waved in his hat, and a shining silver bugle hung from
his shoulder, for he had been following the chase.

He was thirsty and tired, and asked for a drink, but there was no cup
with which to dip the water from the spring. But Olga caught the drops
as they bubbled out from the spring, holding them in the hollow of her
beautiful white hands, and reaching up to where he sat, offered him the
sparkling water. So gracefully was it done, that the Prince was charmed
by her modest manner as well as her lovely face, and baring his head
when he had slaked his thirst, he touched the white hands with his lips.

Before he rode away he asked her name and where she lived. The next day
a courier in scarlet and gold stopped at the door of the cottage and
invited Olga to the castle. Princesses and royal ladies from all over
the realm were to be entertained there, seven days and seven nights.
Every night a grand ball was to be given, and Olga was summoned to each
of the balls. It was because of her pleasing manner and her great
beauty that she had been bidden.

The old Flax-spinner courtesied low to the courier and promised that
Olga should be at the castle without fail.

"But, good dame," cried Olga, when the courier had gone, "prithee tell
me why thou didst make such a promise, knowing full well this gown of
tow is all I own. Wouldst have me stand before the Prince in beggar's
garb? Better to bide at home for aye than be put to shame before such
guests."

"Have done, my child!" the old dame said. "Thou shalt wear a court robe
of the finest. Years have I toiled to have it ready, but that is naught.
I loved thee as my own."

Then once more the old Flax-spinner went into her inner room, and
pricked herself with her spindle till another great red drop of her
heart's blood fell into her trembling hand. With witchery of words she
blew upon it, and rolled it in her palm, and muttering, turned and
turned and turned it. And as the spell was laid upon it, it shrivelled
into a tiny round ball like a seed, and she strung it on to a thread,
where were many others like it. Seventy times seven was the number of
beads on this strange rosary.

When the night of the first ball rolled around, Olga combed her long
golden hair and twined it with a wreath of snowy water-lilies, and then
she stood before the old dame in her dress of tow. To her wonderment
and grief she saw there was no silken robe in waiting, only a string of
beads to clasp around her white throat. Each bead in the necklace was
like a little shrivelled seed, and Olga's eyes filled with tears of
disappointment.

"Obey me and all will be well," said the old woman.

"When thou reachest the castle gate clasp one bead in thy fingers and
say:

     "'For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,
     Blossom and deck me, little seed.'

Straightway right royally shalt thou be clad. But remember carefully the
charm. Only to the magic words, 'For love's sweet sake' will the
necklace give up its treasures. If thou shouldst forget, then thou must
be doomed always to wear thy gown of tow."

So Olga sped on her moon-lighted way through the forest until she came
to the castle gate. There she paused, and grasping a bead of the strange
necklace between her fingers, repeated the old dame's charm:

     "For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,
     Blossom and deck me, little seed."

Immediately the bead burst with a little puff as if a seed pod had
snapped asunder. A faint perfume surrounded her, rare and subtle as if
it had been blown across from some flower of Eden. Olga looked down and
found herself enveloped in a robe of such delicate texture, that it
seemed soft as a rose-leaf and as airy as pink clouds that sometimes
float across the sunset. The water-lilies in her hair had become a
coronal of opals.

When she entered the great ball-room, the Prince of the castle started
up from his throne in amazement. Never before had he seen such a vision
of loveliness. "Surely," said he, "some rose of Paradise hath found a
soul and drifted earthward to blossom here." And all that night he had
eyes for none but her.

The next night Olga started again to the castle in her dress of tow, and
at the gate she grasped the second bead in her fingers, repeating the
charm. This time the pale yellow of the daffodils seemed to have woven
itself into a cloth of gold for her adorning. It was like a shimmer of
moon-beams, and her hair held the diamond flashings of a hundred tiny
stars.

That night the Prince paid her so many compliments and singled her out
so often to bestow his favours, that Olga's head was turned. She tossed
it proudly, and quite scorned the thought of the humble cottage which
had given her shelter so long. The next day when she had returned to
her gown of tow and was no longer a haughty court lady, but only Olga,
the Flax-spinner's maiden, she repined at her lot. Frowning, she carried
the water from the spring. Frowning, she gathered the cresses and
plucked the woodland fruit. And then she sat all day by the spring,
refusing to spread the linen on the grass to bleach.

She was discontented with the old life of toil, and pouted crossly
because duties called her when she wanted to do nothing but sit idly
dreaming of the gay court scenes in which she had taken a bright brief
part. The old Flax-spinner's fingers trembled as she spun, when she saw
the frowns, for she had given of her heart's blood to buy happiness for
this maiden she loved, and well she knew there can be no happiness where
frowns abide. She felt that her years of sacrifice had been in vain, but
when the Oak wagged his head she called back waveringly, "My little Olga
will not be ungrateful and forgetful!"

That night outside the castle gate, Olga paused. She had forgotten the
charm. The day's discontent had darkened her memory as storm-clouds
darken the sky. But she grasped her necklace imperiously.

"Deck me at once!" she cried in a haughty tone. "Clothe me more
beautifully than mortal maid was ever clad before, so that I may find
favour in the Prince's sight and become the bride of the castle! I would
that I were done for ever with the spindle and the distaff!"

But the moon went under a cloud and the wind began to moan around the
turrets. The black night hawks in the forest flapped their wings
warningly, and the black bats flitted low around her head.

"Obey me at once!" she cried angrily, stamping her foot and jerking at
the necklace. But the string broke, and the beads went rolling away in
the darkness in every direction and were lost--all but one, which she
held clasped in her hand.

Then Olga wept at the castle gate; wept outside in the night and the
darkness, in her peasant's garb of tow. But after awhile through her
sobbing, stole the answering sob of the night wind.

"Hush-sh!" it seemed to say. "Sh-sh! Never a heart can come to harm, if
the lips but speak the old dame's charm."

The voice of the night wind sounded so much like the voice of the old
Flax-spinner, that Olga was startled and looked around wonderingly. Then
suddenly she seemed to see the thatched cottage and the bent form of the
lonely old woman at the wheel. All the years in which the good dame had
befriended her seemed to rise up in a row, and out of each one called a
thousand kindnesses as with one voice: "How canst thou forget us, Olga?
We were done for love's sweet sake, and that alone!"

Then was Olga sorry and ashamed that she had been so proud and
forgetful, and she wept again. The tears seemed to clear her vision, for
now she saw plainly that through no power of her own could she wrest
strange favours from fortune. Only the power of the old charm could make
them hers. She remembered it then, and holding fast the one bead in her
hand, she repeated humbly:

     "For love's sweet sake, in my hour of need,
     Blossom and deck me, little seed."

Lo, as the words left her lips, the moon shone out from behind the
clouds above the dark forest. There was a fragrance of lilies all
about, and a gossamer gown floated around her, whiter than the whiteness
of the fairest lily. It was fine like the finest lace the frost-elves
weave, and softer than the softest ermine of the snow. On her long
golden hair gleamed a coronet of pearls.

So beautiful, so dazzling was she as she entered the castle door, that
the Prince came down to meet her, and kneeling, kissed her hand and
claimed her as his bride. Then came the bishop in his mitre, and led her
to the throne, and before them all the Flax-spinner's maiden was married
to the Prince, and made the Princess Olga.

Then until the seven days and seven nights were done, the revels lasted
in the castle. And in the merriment the old Flax-spinner was again
forgotten. Her kindness of the past, her loneliness in the present had
no part in the thoughts of the Princess Olga.

All night the old Oak, tapping on the thatch, called down, "Thou'rt
forgotten! Thou'rt forgotten!"

But the beads that had rolled away in the darkness, buried themselves in
the earth, and took root, and sprang up, as the old woman knew they
would do. There at the castle gate they bloomed, a strange, strange
flower, for on every stem hung a row of little bleeding hearts.

One day the Princess Olga, seeing them from her window, went down to
them in wonderment.

"What do you here?" she cried, for in her forest life she'd learned all
speech of bird and beast and plant.

"We bloom for love's sweet sake," they answered. "We have sprung from
the old Flax-spinner's gift--the necklace thou didst break and scatter.
From her heart's best blood she gave it, and her heart still bleeds to
think she is forgotten."

Then they began to tell the story of the old dame's sacrifices, all the
seventy times seven that she had made for the sake of the maiden, and
Olga grieved as she listened, that she could have been so ungrateful.
Then she brought the Prince to hear the story of the strange, strange
flowers, and when he had heard, together they went to the lowly cottage
and fetched the old Flax-spinner to the castle, there to live out all
her days in ease and contentment.

"See now," she whispered to the Oak at parting, but sturdily he held his
ground, persisting, "Thou _wouldst_ have been forgotten, save for that
miracle of bloom."

_And still the flower we call BLEEDING-HEART blooms on by cottage walls
and castle gardens, to waken all the world to grateful memories. And
ever it doth bring to mind the lonely hearts that bleed because they are
forgotten, and all they sacrificed for love's sweet sake, to give us
happiness._

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
