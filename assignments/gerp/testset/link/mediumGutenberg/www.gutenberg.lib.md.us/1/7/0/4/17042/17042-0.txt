NOTES.

581, 1. Mactciñge, the Rabbit, or Si¢e-makaⁿ (meaning uncertain), is
the hero of numerous myths of several tribes. He is the deliverer of
mankind from different tyrants. One of his opponents is Ictinike, the
maker of this world, according to the Iowas. The Rabbit's grandmother
is Mother Earth, who calls mankind her children.

581, 7. a¢ai te aⁿ. The conclusion of this sentence seems odd to the
collector, but its translation given with this myth is that furnished
by the Indian informant.

581, 12. haⁿ+egaⁿtcĕ-qtci, "ve--ry early in the morning." The
prolongation of the first syllable adds to the force of the adverb
"qtci," _very_.

582, 3. hebe ihe a¢e-hnaⁿ-biama. The Rabbit tried to obey the Sun;
but each time that he attempted it, he was so much afraid of him that
he passed by a little to one side. He could not go directly to him.

582, 4. 5. maⁿciaha aia¢a-biama. When the Rabbit rushed forward with
bowed head, and cut the bow-string, the Sun's departure was so rapid
that "he had _already_ gone on high."


ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS MYTH.

  cv.    curvilinear.
  mv.    moving.
  st.    sitting.
  sub.   subject.
  ob.    object.


TRANSLATION.

Once upon a time the Rabbit dwelt in a lodge with no one but his
grandmother. And it was his custom to go hunting very early in the
morning. No matter how early in the morning he went, a person with
very long feet had been along, leaving a trail. And he (the Rabbit),
wished to know him. "Now," thought he, "I will go in advance of the
person." Having arisen very early in the morning, he departed. Again
it happened that the person had been along, leaving a trail. Then he
(the Rabbit) went home. Said he, "Grandmother, though I arrange for
myself to go first, a person anticipates me (every time). Grandmother,
I will make a snare and catch him." "Why should you do it?" said she.
"I hate the person," he said. And the Rabbit departed. When he went,
the foot-prints had been along again. And he lay waiting for night (to
come). And he made a noose of a bow-string, putting it in the place
where the foot-prints used to be seen. And he reached there very early
in the morning for the purpose of looking at his trap. And it happened
that he had caught the Sun. Running very fast, he went homeward to
tell it. "Grandmother, I have caught something or other, but it
scares me. Grandmother, I wished to take my bow-string, but I was
scared every time," said he. He went thither with a knife. And he got
very near it. "You have done wrong; why have you done so? Come hither
and untie me," said the Sun. The Rabbit, although he went thither, was
afraid, and kept on passing partly by him (or, continued going by a
little to one side). And making a rush, with his head bent down (and
his arm stretched out), he cut the bow-string with the knife. And the
Sun had already gone on high. And the Rabbit had the hair between his
shoulders scorched yellow, it having been hot upon him (as he stooped
to cut the bow-string). (And the Rabbit arrived at home.) "Itcitci+!!
O grandmother, the heat has left nothing of me," said he. She said,
"Oh! my grandchild! I think that the heat has left nothing of him for
me." (From that time the rabbit has had a singed spot on his back,
between the shoulders.)

NOTES.

583, 1. shuákia does not mean to "_call on somebody_" generally, but
only "_to call on the conjurer_ or medicine man".

583, 2. wán stands for wánam nī'l: the fur or skin of a red
or silver fox; kaníta pî'sh stands for kanítana látchash m'nálam:
"outside of his lodge or cabin". The meaning of the sentence is: they
raise their voices to call him out. Conjurers are in the habit of
fastening a fox-skin outside of their lodges, as a business sign, and
to let it dangle from a rod stuck out in an oblique direction.

583, 3. tchélχa. During the treatment of a patient, who stays in
a winter house, the lodge is often shut up at the top, and the people
sit in a circle inside in utter darkness.

583, 5. liukiámnank. The women and all who take a part in the chorus
usually sit in a circle around the conjurer and his assistant; the
suffix -mna indicates close proximity. Nadshā'shak qualifies the
verb winóta.

583, 5. tchûtchtníshash. The distributive form of tchû't’na refers
to each of the _various_ manipulations performed by the conjurer on
the patient.

584, 1. mā'shish, shortened from māshípkash, mā'shipksh, like
ḵ'lä'ksh from k’läkápkash.

584, 2. 3. There is a stylistic incongruity in using the distributive
form, only in kukuàga (kúe, _frog_), káhaktok, and in nshendshkáne
(nshekáni, npshékani, tsékani, tchékĕni, _small_), while inserting
the absolute form in wishinkága (wíshink, _garter-snake_) and in
ḵáḵo; mû'lkaga is more of a generic term and its distributive
form is therefore not in use.

583, 2. káhaktok for ká-akt ak; ká-akt being the transposed
distributive form kákat, of kát, which, what (pron. relat.).

584, 4. lgû'm. The application of remedial _drugs_ is very unfrequent
in this tribe; and this is one of the reasons why the term "conjurer"
or "shaman" will prove to be a better name for the medicine man than
that of "Indian doctor".

584, 4. kû'tash etc. The conjurer introduces a louse into the eye to
make it eat up the protruding white portion of the sore eye.

585, 1. náyäns hissuáksas: another man than the conjurers of the
tribe. The objective case shows that mā'shitk has to be regarded
here as the participle of an impersonal verb: mā'sha nûsh, and
mā'sha nû, it ails me, I am sick.

585, 2. yá-uks is remedy in general, spiritual as well as material.
Here a tamánuash song is meant by it, which, when sung by the
conjurer, will furnish him the certainty if his patient is a relapse
or not. There are several of these medicine-songs, but all of them
(nánuk hû'k shuī'sh) when consulted point out the spider-medicine
as the one to apply in this case. The spider's curing-instrument is
that small piece of buckskin (ubá-ush) which has to be inserted under
the patient's skin. It is called the spider's medicine because the
spider-song is sung during its application.

585, 10. gutä'ga. The whole operation is concealed from the eyes of
spectators by a skin or blanket stretched over the patient and the
hands of the operator.

585, 10. kiatéga. The buckskin piece has an oblong or longitudinal
shape in most instances, and it is passed under the skin sideways and
very gradually.

585, 11. tánkĕni ak waítash. Dave Hill gave as an approximate limit
five days' time.

NOTES.

No Klamath or Modoc sweat-lodge can be properly called a
sweat-_house_, as is the custom throughout the West. One kind of these
lodges, intended for the use of mourners only, are solid structures,
almost underground; three of them are now in existence, all believed
to be the gift of the principal national deity. Sudatories of the
other kind are found near every Indian lodge, and consist of a few
willow-rods stuck into the ground, both ends being bent over. The
process gone through while sweating is the same in both kinds of
lodges, with the only difference as to time. The ceremonies mentioned
4-13. all refer to sweating in the mourners' sweat-lodges. The
sudatories of the Oregonians have no analogy with the _estufas_ of
the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, as far as their construction is
concerned.

586, 1. lápa spû'klish, two sweat-lodges, stands for two _kinds_ of
sweat-lodges.

586, 5. shashámoks=lólatko forms _one_ compound word: one who, or:
those who have lost relatives by death; cf. ptísh=lûlsh, pgísh=lûlsh;
hishuákga ptísh=lúlatk, male orphan whose father has died. In the
same manner, ḵĕlekátko stands here as a participle referring
simultaneously to híshuaksh and to snáwedsh wénuitk, and can be
rendered by "_bereaved_". Shashámoks, distr. form of shá-amoks,
is often pronounced sheshámaks. Túmi etc. means, that many others
accompany to the sweat-lodge, into which about six persons can crowd
themselves, bereaved husbands, wives or parents, because the deceased
were related to them.

586, 7. Shiúlakiank etc. For developing steam the natives collect
only such stones for heating as are neither too large nor too small;
a medium size seeming most appropriate for concentrating the largest
amount of heat. The old sweat-lodges are surrounded with large
accumulations of stones which, to judge from their blackened exterior,
have served the purpose of generating steam; they weigh not over 3 to
5 pounds in the average, and in the vicinity travelers discover many
small cairns, not over four feet high, and others lying in ruins.
The shrubbery around the sudatory is in many localities tied up with
willow wisps and ropes.

586, 11. Spukli-uápka mā'ntch means that the sweating-process is
repeated many times during the five days of observance; they sweat at
least twice a day.

NOTES.

588, 24. This word "hduze" means _to take_ or _hold one's own;_
and is most commonly applied to a man's taking a wife, or a woman
a husband. Here it may mean either that one who starts in a wicked
course consorts with others "more wicked than himself," or that he
himself grows in the bad and takes hold of the greater forms of
evil--_marries_ himself to the wicked one.

It will be noted from this specimen of Dakota that there are
some particles in the language which cannot be represented in a
translation. The "do" used at the end of phrases or sentences is
only for emphasis and to round up a period. It belongs mainly to the
language of young men. "Wo" and "po" are the signs of the imperative.


TRANSLATION.

There was a dog; and there was an old woman who had a pack of dried
meat laid away. This the dog knew; and, when he supposed the old woman
was asleep, he went there at night. But the old woman was aware of his
coming and so kept watch, and, as the dog thrust his head under the
tent, she struck him across the face and made a great gash, which
swelled greatly.

The next morning a companion dog came and attempted to talk with him.
But the dog was sullen and silent. The visitor said: "Tell me what
makes you so heart-sick." To which he replied: "Be still, an old woman
has treated me badly." "What did she do to you?" He answered: "An old
woman had a pack of dried meat; this I saw and went for it; and when
it was now far in the night, and I supposed she was asleep, I went
there and poked my head under the tent. But she was lying awake and
cried out: 'Shoo! what are you doing here?' and struck me on the head
and wounded me as you see."

Whereupon the other dog said: "Alas! Alas! she has treated you
badly, verily we will eat up her pack of meat. Call an assembly:
call _Water-mist_ (i.e., rain); call _Bite-off-silently_; call
_Strong-neck_; call _Sharp-knife_." So he invited them all. And when
they had all arrived, he said: "Come on! an old woman has treated this
friend badly; bestir yourselves; before the night is past, the pack of
dried meat which she prizes so much, and on account of which she has
thus dealt with our friend, that we will eat all up".

Then the one who is called _Rain-mist_ caused it to rain, and it
rained all the day through until dark; and the tent was all drenched,
and the holes of the tent-pins were thoroughly softened. Then
_Bite-off-silently_ bit off all the lower tent-fastenings, but
he did it so quietly that the old woman knew nothing of it. Then
_Strong-neck_ came and seized the pack with his mouth, and carried it
far away. Whereupon _Sharp-knife_ came and ripped the pack through the
middle; and so, while it was yet night, they ate up the old woman's
pack of dried meat.

_Moral_.--A common thief becomes worse and worse by attaching himself
to more daring companions. This is the myth.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
