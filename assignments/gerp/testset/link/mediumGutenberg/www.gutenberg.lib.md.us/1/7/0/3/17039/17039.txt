During the months of August and September, 1896, the writer visited
the shores of Penobscot River and Bay in the interests of the United
States Fish Commission, for the purpose of securing data regarding
the condition and extent of the salmon, shad, and alewife fisheries.
Special attention was given to the salmon fishery, as the Penobscot
is now the only important salmon stream on the Atlantic coast of the
United States and has been the field for very extensive fish-cultural
operations on the part of the Fish Commission. A large majority of the
owners of the salmon weirs and nets along both sides of the bay and
river were interviewed and accurate accounts of their fishing obtained,
together with their observations as to the effect of artificial
propagation on the supply.

The history and methods of the salmon fishery of this basin have been
well presented in papers by Mr. Charles G. Atkins, superintendent of
the Government hatchery at Craig Brook, Maine. [1,2] The present paper
is primarily intended to show the extent and condition of the salmon
fishery of Penobscot Bay and River in 1895 and 1896 and the influence
of artificial propagation on the supply. The methods and apparatus of
the fishery are briefly considered. A chart of the Penobscot region,
giving the location of salmon weirs and traps in use in 1896, is
appended, and illustrations of some of the types of salmon apparatus
are shown.

Extent and condition of the fishery in 1895 and 1896.

While the number of nets operated in these two years was practically
the same, the catch in 1896 was much greater than in 1895, and was one
of the largest in the recent history of the fishery. A comparatively
large number of fishermen reported that they took more salmon than in
any previous year. The salmon, however, were smaller than usual, and
their market value was but little more in 1896 than in 1895.

The traps set especially for salmon, or in which salmon were taken,
numbered 193 in 1895 and 184 in 1896. These, with the accessories,
had a value of $12,474 and $13,146, respectively. The boats and scows
required in the construction and operation of the nets numbered 188
in 1895, the same in 1896, and were valued at $3,576 and $3,599,
respectively. The number of men engaged in the fishery was 127 in
1895 and 126 in 1896. In the comparatively unimportant branch of the
fishery carried on with gill nets in the vicinity of Bangor, 10 nets,
valued at $189, were used in 1895, and 11 nets, worth $199, in 1896;
these were set by 6 men in the first year and 7 in the next. The boats
numbered 4 in 1895 and 5 in 1896, and were valued at $29 and $37,
respectively.

The total number of salmon caught in 1895 was 4,395; these weighed
65,011 pounds and yielded the fishermen $11,356; in gill nets 117
salmon were caught, weighing 1,985 pounds and valued at $323. In 1896
the result of the fishery was 6,403 salmon, weighing 80,175 pounds,
with a market value of $12,716; the gill-net catch this year was 246
salmon, with a weight of 3,444 pounds and a value of $492.

The outcome of the fishery in 1896 exceeded that of 1895 by 2,008
salmon; increase in weight was 15,164 pounds, and in value $1,360. The
percentage of increase in these items was as follows: Fish taken, 46
per cent; weight of catch, 23 per cent; value of catch, 12 per cent.

As an illustration of the uniform increase in the number of salmon
taken in 1896, the following facts may be cited: The nets that were
set in both years numbered 162; of these, 146 nets, or 90 per cent,
took more salmon in 1896 than in 1895; and only 16, or 10 per cent,
took the same number or less. The comparative figures for the nets
that secured more fish in 1896 were 3,449 salmon in 1895 and 5,681 in
1896. The nets whose catch was the same or less in 1896 caught 295
fish in 1895 and 289 in 1896.

The largest number of salmon taken by one fisherman in 1895 was 408;
these were caught in 3 nets on the lower side of Sears Island, in the
township of Searsport. Other catches by single fishermen in 1895 were
104 salmon in 4 nets in Stockton, 102 in 5 nets in Northport, 150 in 3
nets in Islesboro, and 150 in 3 nets in Verona.

In 1896 the 3 Searsport nets first mentioned took 426 salmon, and a
large number of fishermen secured between 100 and 200 fish in 2 to 5
nets. Thus, in Stockton 100 fish were caught in 2 nets, 105 in 3 nets,
and 110 in 1 net; in Penobscot 192 salmon were taken in 2 nets, 105 in
2 nets, and 127 in 2 nets; in Northport 5 nets obtained 204 fish and 4
nets 125 fish; in Islesboro 3 nets took 130 fish, 3 nets 150 fish, 4
nets 190 fish, and 2 nets 100 fish; in Verona 3 nets caught 174 fish,
2 nets 106 fish, 3 nets 150 fish, 1 net 100 fish, and 2 nets 170 fish.

About 80 per cent of the fishing is done in that part of the river
between the northern end of Whitmore Island and Islesboro. While
single weirs in that part of the river between Bucksport and Bangor
may take as many as 50 or 60 salmon some seasons, the average was only
14 in 1895 and 26 in 1896, and the aggregate is comparatively small.
In the townships of Lincolnville and Camden, which are the lowest
points in the Penobscot region at which salmon fishing is done, the
average catch to a net in 1895 was only 16 salmon and in 1896 only 19
salmon.

Comparative data relative to the salmon fishery.

In 1880 the catch of salmon in Penobscot Bay and River and their
tributaries was 10,016, having an estimated weight of 110,176 pounds.
The weirs and traps used numbered 230; the gill nets, 36. The fishery
yielded 169,894 pounds, valued at $32,800, in 1887; 192,177 pounds,
worth $38,049, in 1888; 140,469 pounds, valued at $31,156, in 1889,
and 92,282 pounds, worth $19,124, in 1892.

As previously shown, in 1895 193 traps and 10 gill nets took 4,395
salmon, weighing 65,011 pounds, valued at $11,356, and in 1896, 184
traps and 11 gill nets caught 6,403 salmon, weighing 80,175 pounds,
valued at $12,716.

Comparing 1896 with 1880, it appears that there was a reduction of 27
per cent in the number of nets used and a decrease of 36 per cent in
the number of salmon caught. A relatively large catch was made in 1887
to 1889, inclusive, and the decrease in 1896, as compared with those
years, was marked. From 1892 to 1895 the output declined nearly 30
per cent, and the general tendency for the past eight years has been
toward a decrease, 1896 presenting a very pleasing contrast, of which
the fishermen all make mention.

Following is a continuous record from 1874 to 1896 of two of the most
successful salmon weirs. These are located on the east side of the
river, in the town of Penobscot, a short distance from the southern
end of Whitmore Island. The number of salmon taken in 1896 was 20 per
cent greater than in any previous year and over 93 per cent greater
than the average for the preceding 22 years. Similar comparative
statements for other nets are at hand, showing the increase in 1896
over previous seasons.

   out. Occasionally they are put in place before the ice leaves.




Apparatus and methods of the fishery.

There is probably no other river in the United States in which a
fishery of such magnitude has undergone so few changes with respect
to methods, number of traps operated, and sites where nets are set,
as the Penobscot. This is chiefly owing (1) to the character of the
bottom, (2) to the fact that the fishing is a riparian privilege
enjoyed only by those who own land fronting on the water,
(3) to the circumstance that the fishing is almost entirely of a
semi-professional character, and has been taken up by generation after
generation as a part of the regular duties connected with the small
farms, and (4) to the small number of food-fishes occurring in the
river, and the preponderating importance of two of them--the salmon
and the alewife--for which the nets are exclusively set.

The salmon fishery of the Penobscot basin is carried on with
practically a single type of apparatus, namely, the brush weir. In
most parts of the region this trap is used in the same form that it
had in the primitive days of the fishery, but in some sections the
weir has undergone evolution into a combination brush and twine trap,
and in places into a trap made wholly of netting.

Some of the types of salmon nets used in this region are illustrated
and described by the accompanying figures. In addition to these, which
are wholly or partly of brush, a common apparatus is the floating
trap, constructed entirely of twine, such as is now generally employed
in the New England States. This is the only salmon net in use at
Islesboro and in some other sections. The local and individual
variations in the form of the nets depend on the topography of the
bottom and shore and the habits of the salmon, and are the result of
long experience.

The fishing begins as soon as the ice moves out in spring and
continues until some time in July. Fish are rarely taken before
the last two weeks in April. May and June are the best months. In
that part of the river adjacent to Bangor there is a small fishery
prosecuted with set gill nets. The nets are from 100 to 200 feet long
and have a 6-inch mesh.



   Salmon weir, Castine. Hedge 200 feet long, made of stakes
   driven in mud interwoven with brush to low-water mark,
   covered with netting beyond. Great pound, 30 feet long,
   30 feet wide at base, made of netting; entrance 8 feet
   wide. Inner pounds, 10 feet wide, with board floors;
   outer entrance 2 feet wide, inner 1 foot. Value, $70.

Salmon at Matinicus and Ragged islands.

Matinicus is a small island located south of Penobscot Bay and about 15
miles southeast of the nearest mainland (Thomaston). It is in the route
of salmon coming in from the sea to ascend the river, and nets set in
favorable positions would naturally be expected to intercept the fish.
On the western side of the island Messrs. R. Crie & Sons have operated
a trap for mackerel and herring for four years, and during that time
have incidentally taken a number of salmon. Between May 20 and July 10
marketable fish are caught, while in August and September salmon too
small to utilize are taken in considerable quantities; in the opinion
of the Messrs. Crie these small fish were on their way to sea from the
Penobscot River. It has been observed that when an easterly wind is
blowing very few salmon are taken, but during a westerly wind salmon
are always obtained in the months named, and the quantity of salmon
secured in any given year bears a close relation to the direction of
the prevailing winds. In 1895 the number of marketable salmon caught
was 65; in 1896 the catch was 167. The largest fish taken in the two
years weighed 30 pounds, the smallest 1/2 pound. The largest daily
catch was 31 salmon, in 1896; the next largest, 27, in 1894.

Mr. W. B. Young, of Matinicus Island, has a herring weir on the
southwestern part of Ragged Island, which lies a short distance south
of Matinicus Island. In 1896 this weir during June and July caught 15
salmon with an aggregate weight of 200 pounds. The largest weighed
24 1/2 pounds. No small, unmarketable ones were obtained.




Salmon at the Cranberry Isles.

The Cranberry Isles lie  a few miles south of Mount Desert Island
and about 25 miles east of Penobscot Bay. They are in the track of
migrating salmon, as a few herring weirs set around the islands have
for several years taken one or more salmon almost annually. [3] Mr. W.
I. Mayo, a correspondent at the islands, reports that in June, 1895,
Colonel Hadlock took a 17-pound salmon in a weir, and on May 5 of the
same year Mr. Mayo caught one weighing 19 pounds. None had been taken,
however, in 1896 up to September 1.

   [Footnote 3: See paper entitled "Notes on the capture
   of Atlantic salmon at sea and in the coast waters of
   the Eastern States," Bull. U.S.F.C. 1894.]




Salmon caught with hook off Maine coast.

Instances are multiplying of the taking of salmon at sea on trawl lines
on the New England coast. The salmon are usually taken during the time
when the fish are running in the rivers, but occasionally one has been
caught in midwinter. The following data relate to fish that probably
belonged to the Penobscot school.

On June 19, 1896 a Gloucester fishing vessel brought into Rockland a
10-pound salmon that had been caught on a cod trawl 20 miles southeast
of Matinicus. The fish was sent home to Gloucester by the captain of
the vessel, through Mr. Charles E. Weeks, a Rockland fish-dealer.

Several salmon have been taken on hooks off Frenchman Bay within a few
years. One 25-pound fish was caught on a cod trawl 3 miles off
Gouldsboro, in 20 fathoms of water, and another was taken southeast of
Mount Desert Island in 35 fathoms.

Some years ago, on May 22, one of the crew of the schooner _Telephone_,
of Orland, Me., while fishing for cod on German Bank, caught a 10-pound
salmon. German Bank lies about 50 miles southeast of Mount Desert
Island and has 65 to 100 fathoms of water.




Destruction of salmon by seals.

Seals are known to kill a great many salmon in Penobscot Bay and
the lower river. They enter and leave the weirs and traps without
difficulty and cause great annoyance to the fishermen. When a seal
enters a net, the fish are frightened and usually become meshed; the
seal may then devour them at its leisure. The initial bite usually
includes the salmon's head.

Fishermen in some places report a noticeable increase in seals in the
past few years, and a consequent increase in damage done to the salmon
fishery. The State pays a bounty of $1 each for seal scalps, which
serves to keep the seals somewhat in check, although the sagacity of
the animals makes it difficult to approach them with a rifle and to
secure them when shot. Within a few years some weir fishermen have been
obliged at times to patrol the waters in the vicinity of their nets, in
order to prevent depredations. In the Cape Rosier region, where some
salmon trap fishing is done, seals were very troublesome in the early
part of the season of 1896. Mr. George Ames, who set three traps in
1896 and took about 100 salmon, had knowledge of 13 other salmon that
were destroyed by seals while in his nets. Similar instances of
relatively large numbers of salmon killed by seals might be given. With
salmon worth 20 to 50 cents a pound the loss of 10 or 12 salmon by
seals, in a total catch of 75 or 100, is a matter of importance to the
fisherman.




Evidences of results of propagation.

The opinion is now practically unanimous among the salmon fishermen of
Penobscot River and Bay that the artificial hatching of salmon by the
U.S. Fish Commission is producing beneficial results. About the same
arguments in support of their opinions are presented by all, and these
accord well in the main with the observations of other persons who have
given this matter attention:

(1) The opportunities for natural reproduction are exceedingly limited,
owing to the obstructions to the passage of the fish to their spawning
grounds in the headwaters of the Penobscot basin.

(2) The salmon that are naturally hatched are, even under the most
favorable conditions prevailing at the present time, not numerous
enough to keep up the supply of market and brood fish, with the
fatalities incident to the long residence at sea and to the passage of
immature fish down from the spawning grounds to the sea.

(3) The remarkable run in May and June, 1896, of fish of comparatively
small size that had apparently just reached maturity and the relative
scarcity of large fish that had evidently been in the river during one
or two previous seasons seemed to show a tendency toward the depletion
of the run of old fish and the substitution of a run of young,
artificially hatched fish.

(4) A feature of the salmon supply in recent years, on which the
fishermen nearly all lay considerable stress, is that the runs in
April and July, which in former years were often quite important and
remunerative, have of late been very poor, although the fish
constituting them are of large size, while the runs in May and June
have kept up, but have consisted chiefly of comparatively small fish.
In this the fishermen believe they see evidence of the work of the
hatchery, for the young salmon artificially hatched have been from eggs
of May and June fish, and the fishermen think that such young fish,
when they return to the river to spawn, will come at about the same
time that their parents did.

Many salmon fishermen might be quoted on the question of results of
propagation. A few sample statements and records of salmon taken will
be given covering different parts of the bay and river.

Mr. Francis French, an experienced salmon fisherman of Stockton, on the
western side of Penobscot Bay, reports that of the 61 salmon taken in
his weir in 1896, 56 were under 11 pounds in weight, and all evidently
belonged to the same year's brood. In 1895 the 29 salmon obtained by
Mr. French averaged 20 pounds each. According to his observations, a
very large percentage of the salmon in the Penobscot region in 1896
were hatchery fish that then entered the river for the first time.

Mr. A. H. Whitmore, a salmon fisherman of over thirty years'
experience, who fishes three weirs off the southern end of Whitmore
Island, states that in that part of the river the catch in 1896 was the
largest in thirty years, with the exception of one season. He thinks
there is no doubt whatever of the beneficial results of artificial
propagation, as shown by the maintenance of the supply when
obstructions to the passage of salmon to the upper waters must greatly
curtail natural spawning.

Mr. Joseph Hurd, of Winterport, has two weirs at Oak Point, which is
the upper limit of weir fishing for salmon on the west side of the
river; the nets are about 12 miles below Bangor; 25 salmon were taken
in 1895, and 60 in the following year. The catch was better in 1896
than in a number of years. Eight years before, Mr. Hurd took 140
salmon, which was the best season in his experience; since then the
fish have been decreasing until 1896. He thinks very few fish get to
their spawning-grounds, owing to dams and other obstructions in the
river above Bangor, and has no doubt the small fish which were so
conspicuous in 1896 were from the Government hatchery.

Mr. William F. Abbott, of Verona, who has two weirs on Whitmore Island,
caught 41 salmon in 1895, and 80 in 1896. He makes the following
statement:

"In my opinion, there would not enough salmon come into the river to
pay for building weirs if there had been no salmon artificially hatched;
and I hope the Government will continue to keep the salmon fishing up,
so it will pay to build our weirs. No person that knows anything about
it can doubt that it is a good thing for the fishermen."

Mr. Harvey Heath, of Verona, has two weirs on the eastern side of the
southern end of Whitmore Island. He caught 62 salmon in 1895, and 100
in 1896. He thinks that the removal of obstructions to the passage of
fish to their spawning-grounds would be all that is necessary to secure
a good run of fish in the river, but believes that under present
conditions the salmon-cultural work of the Government is very useful in
sustaining the fishery.

Three weirs of Mr. E. A. Bowden, located on the eastern side of
Whitmore Island, above those of Mr. Heath, took, 31 salmon in 1895, and
85 in 1896. Mr. Bowden says:

"I think that if it was not for the hatchery we would not have any
salmon to speak of, for all the school we have is in June.  April, May,
and July salmon are very scarce."

Mr. Charles G. Atkins, superintendent of the government salmon hatchery
in Orland, Me., informs the writer that he has been inclined to believe
that each year a great many salmon succeed in reaching their spawning
grounds; but recent observations have caused him to change his mind,
and he is now of the opinion that only relatively few salmon elude the
traps, weirs, and gill nets, surmount the dams and fishways, escape the
poachers, and succeed in depositing their eggs under conditions
favorable to their development. The dam at Bangor, while certainly a
formidable obstruction to the passage of fish, is probably passable at
high water. It is provided with a fishway, and some fish are known to
surmount the dam by this means. Above Bangor, in the main river, there
are dams at Great Works and Montague, the dam at Montague being an
especially serious obstruction, although it is provided with a good
fishway. Below the dam at Bangor there is little poaching, but below
the other dams--especially at Montague--comparatively large numbers of
salmon are sacrificed by the illegal use of the spear and drift net. In
1896 all the salmon below Montague were at the mercy of poachers after
July 15, when all wardens on the river were laid off. The supply of
spawning fish was thus greatly reduced. The people above Bangor have no
interest in preserving the salmon supply of the river, as they receive
none of the benefits from fishing which are enjoyed by fishermen of the
lower river.

This year Mr. Atkins, having this matter under consideration, visited
the east branch of the Penobscot River. A certain tributary of the east
branch, which was said to be one of the best spawning-grounds for
salmon in the Penobscot basin, was obstructed by a dam in the spawning
region. The dam was impassable to fish in July, and had been so during
the previous months. In a deep pool below the dam, which was reported
to be a favorite resort for salmon each season, no salmon were found.
In other words, if the salmon had reached this stream they could not
have gotten above the dam, and would undoubtedly have congregated in
the pool mentioned and been noticed, but no fish had ascended even that
far.




Extension of salmon-hatching operations on the Penobscot.

The establishment of branch hatcheries has been suggested in order to
utilize the spawning salmon in the region which lies above commercial
fishing, and thus increase by artificial means the production of young
fish.  It is well known that even under the best conditions now
prevailing in our streams the eggs of anadromous fishes like the salmon
and shad are liable to numerous destructive agencies; that only a small
percentage of the eggs laid under natural surroundings ever hatch, and
that the young are subject to heavy mortality up to the time when they
leave the river and enter the salt water. Probably 5 per cent would
be much too large an estimate of the number of salmon eggs which in a
state of nature produce fish  that reach the ocean. Fish-culture, on
the other hand, hatches 95 per cent of the eggs and raises 75 per cent
of the fry to the age of yearlings. Of 206,350 Atlantic salmon eggs
obtained in 1895 at the government station at Craig Brook, 206,109
were hatched and 151,761 yearling fish were liberated in the fall.
The percentage of eggs hatched was thus 99.88 and the percentage of
yearlings raised was 78.39. This is sufficient ground for interfering
with the salmon even after they have reached their spawning-beds, and
justifies the establishment of hatcheries in the headwaters of the
Penobscot, provided the supply of fish in any section is large enough
to insure a reasonable take of eggs.

No examinations of the upper tributaries of the Penobscot thus far made
have disclosed the existence of any stream on which the construction of
a branch salmon hatchery is warranted, owing to the few salmon
obtainable. The matter deserves further investigation, however, and
will receive due consideration at an early date. It is thought that a
satisfactory supply of fish may be secured by constructing a dam or
rack which will intercept fish in the main stream and lead practically
the entire run into one tributary, where they may be retained.

The operation of a branch salmon hatchery in the river above Bangor
would of course depend on the successful working of the fishways and
the enforcement by the State of the anti-poaching laws.




Planting of quinnat salmon and steelhead trout in Maine streams.

The United States Fish Commission is making the experiment of planting
large numbers of non-indigenous salmon in the Penobscot Basin and other
Maine waters with a view to test whether the fishes are adapted to
those streams. The species with which trials have thus far been made
are the quinnat or chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tschawytscha_) and
the steelhead trout (_Salmo gairdneri_). It is intended to plant
sufficiently large numbers of yearling fish to fully test the
feasibility of the project; and in the event of success two extremely
valuable species will have been added to the fishery resources of the
Maine streams.

During the years 1896 and 1897 over 2,000,000 young quinnat salmon and
steelheads were deposited by the Commission in the Penobscot River and
adjacent waters, several hundred thousand of which were four to six
months old. The planting of additional fry and yearlings is
contemplated in order to thoroughly demonstrate whether their
introduction is possible.

The quinnat salmon ranges along practically the entire Pacific Coast
of North America north of Mexico, entering all suitable streams. It is
the most valuable member of the salmon family, and is taken in very
large quantities for canning, salting, and fresh consumption. Its
flesh is very rich and of a deep-red color. It is caught in the rivers
with gill nets, seines, pound nets, traps, weirs, wheels, and other
appliances. In Monterey Bay, California, large numbers are taken with
trolling hooks baited with small fish, and, although the fish abstains
from food after entering the fresh waters, it may often be lured with
artificial or other baits. The chinook salmon begins to enter the
California rivers in February, the Columbia in March, and the Alaskan
rivers in May and June. The spawning season covers six months,
extending from June to December, although the spawning period in any
given basin is more limited, seldom exceeding one or two months. The
highest accessible positions in the streams are sought by the spawning
fish, which make rounded excavations in gravelly bottoms, in which the
eggs are deposited. The vitality of the fish rapidly decreases after
spawning, their bodies become mutilated and diseased, and in a short
time they die.

The steelhead (_Salmo gairdneri_) also known by the names of salmon
trout, winter salmon, and Gairdner's trout, closely resembles the
Atlantic salmon in size, form, and habits. It is found from southern
California to Alaska, and enters the coast rivers in large numbers.
Its flesh is light-colored, but is of excellent flavor, being not
inferior to the eastern salmon. It is caught in large quantities with
gill nets and traps, for canning and use in a fresh condition. As
a game fish the steelhead enjoys a high reputation in the Pacific
States. Its principal run in the rivers is during the fall and winter
months, when it ascends the streams long distances, spawning in late
winter or early spring.

In order that anglers, fishermen, fish-dealers, and others may be
able to distinguish from the Atlantic salmon and from each other
any specimens of quinnat salmon and steelhead that come to their
notice, the following key [4] has been prepared to cover the principal
differential characters, and illustrations of the three species are
shown:

   [Footnote 4: The parts referred to in the key may be defined
   as follows: Anal fin, the single fin on the median line of
   the body, between the vent and the tail; gillrakers, bony
   protuberances on the concave side of the bones supporting
   the gills; branchiostegals, small bones supporting the
   lower margin of the  gill cover; pyloric coeca, worm-like
   appendages of the lower end of the stomach; vomer, a bone in
   the front part of the roof of the mouth.]

I. Anal fin elongate, with 16 rays; gillrakers 9 + 14; branchiostegals
    15 to 19; pyloric coeca 140 to 180; caudal fin considerably
    forked; average weight about 20 pounds, maximum 100 pounds.
    Quinnat salmon.

      [Illustration: Chinook or quinnat salmon (_Oncorhynchus
       tschawytscha_)]

II. Anal fin short, with 9 to 12 rays; gillrakers 8 + 12:
    branchiostegals 11; pyloric coeca less than 70.

   1. Teeth on vomer little developed, those on shaft few and
      deciduous; scales large, about 120 in lateral series;
      pyloric coeca 65; caudal fin emarginate; average weight
      15 pounds, maximum 40 pounds.
      Atlantic salmon.

      [Illustration: Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_)]

   2. Teeth on vomer well developed, those on shaft of bone
      numerous and persistent in a zigzag row or two alternating
      series; scales about 150 (130 to 180) in lateral series;
      pyloric coeca 42; caudal fin squarely emarginate; average
      weight 10 pounds, maximum 20 pounds.
      Steelhead trout.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
