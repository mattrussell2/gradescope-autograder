QUITE FABULOUS!

(_A STORY OF THE TIMES, DEDICATED TO PROFESSOR MUNRO._)

KING COLE, although described as a "merry old soul," was in reality
a tyrant. He had a number of subjects who used to work underground,
and their labour was to bring to the surface the black diamonds of
the earth. It was not altogether a pleasant occupation, but still,
the task had to be accomplished. His Majesty was fond of ferocious
practical jokes, and perchance this may have been the origin of
the jocular description attached to his name. One day, some of his
subjects complained that their hours of labour were too many.

"How long do you work?" asked the King.

"May it please you, Sire, sixteen," was the reply.

"Try what you can do with twelve," and they were about to depart
rejoicing, when the Monarch called them back and added, "But mind you,
I shall expect just as many black diamonds to be unearthed as before."

So the King's subjects worked only twelve hours, and strange to say,
quite as many black diamonds were produced as in the olden days. Then
the workmen began to grumble once more, and the King again interviewed
them.

"Do you still work twelve hours?" he asked the deputation.

"Certainly, Your Majesty; but we think half would be quite enough,"
returned the spokesman.

"By all means--why not make it three hours?" and again his subjects
were departing, rejoicing, when once more he added, "But I shall
expect just the same output as before."

And he got it, for the men worked harder than ever. And then they
came yet again to him. Once more they considered the hours of labour
excessive. They thought sixty minutes plenty.

"So do I," replied the Monarch, "not only plenty, but too many. But
as it is scarcely worth while employing you only half an hour a day,
I shall make other arrangements."

And from that time forth he brought up his black diamonds from the
centre of the earth by machinery!

In the Christmas Numbers of the numerous picture-papers it is at first
rather difficult to discover which is the genuine article illustrated,
and which the advertisement, likewise illustrated. In the outside
picture of the Christmas Number of _The Penny Illustrated Paper_,
which represents a couple dancing together, I am not yet quite sure
that the handsome Hebraic gentleman, dancing with a fair Anglo-Saxon
girl, is not assuring his frightened-looking partner that "Epps's
Cocoa is Grateful--Comforting," as stated in the paragraph immediately
beneath the aforesaid picture. On the next page is a sad illustration
entitled, "The Curse of Revenge. Lost to Human Aid." which turns out
to be not a Christmas story at all, but an advertisement for Fruit
Salt. Then opposite this commences a story by GEORGE R. SIMS; and at
the foot of this page some one replies, "Mr. DOOLAN! There's no one
of that name here now, Sir." Whereupon, being interested, the reader
turns over page 1 to find at the head of page 2, not the continuation
of the above interesting story in the shape of some remark on the part
of the inquirer, nor any account of what happened after this reply
had been given, but simply "Benson's Watches" followed by "Fry's
Chocolate," then a picture (not an advertisement) facing that, and
then on page 4 the remainder of the dialogue. It doesn't much matter
perhaps, as the excitement aroused by the story is not violent, and
the mistake of giving somebody else's card for your own does not occur
here for the first time as the motive of a plot. CUTHBERT BEDE's name
is to a "Christmas Carol," and Mr. JOHN LATEY's to a dramatically told
tale called "Mark Temple's Trial," in which the imaginary heroine
pays a visit to a very real person of the name of Madame KATTI
LANNER, whose pupils are represented as all assembled, with bouquets
and posies, to do honour to the birthday of their "well-loved
mistress," who is at the same time, "the acknowledged mistress of the
choreographic art." In this story, the author is to be complimented
on his invention of the name, "Lord Morgagemore" as an ancient looking
and highly aristocratic Irish title.

"Up to any game at Christmas, if it's not too high," says the Baron
of Hampershire, who detests all game that is lofty, but is glad to
welcome a Shakspearian Revival by MYERS & Co. in the shape of a _Nine
Men's Morris_, a title the Baron recommends to the notice of Mr.
WILLIAM MORRIS, yclept "BILLY," when he is making another bouquet of
poesies. By the way, BIM BROS.' Almanac Cards, one of the Baron's
Lady Helps describes as "decidedly dainty." Christmas is specially a
card-playing season, a time of _Pax_ to everybody.

From the _Gordon Stables_ of HUTCHINSON & Co. issues the nightmare
tale of _The Cruise in the Crystal Boat_; when finished, try their
_Family Difficulty_, by SARAH DOUDNEY. Send to the Deanery of DEAN AND
SON, ask for _Baby's Biography_ and _The Little One's Own Beehive_.
The Spindleside department of the Baron's Booking-Office recommends
both the above for the Tiny Trots; while the Spearside tells the
boys to go in for MANVILLE FENN's _Burr Junior_ and Mrs. R. LEE's
_Adventures in Australia_. Then for all-comers, procure BEATRICE
HARRADEN's _New Book of Fairies_, for, our "Co." thus puts it, "This
is all concerning those poor little Fairies, about whom no one takes
any trouble, and who are left out in the cold at Christmas time."
Thus for this week conclude the duties of Mesdames BLYTHE and GAY,
the Baron's Lady Assistant Perusers. "I trust my gentle Public will
benefit by their advice," quoth,

    ["You will not find an alliance in which the weaker side has
    been so loyal, so straight, so single-hearted, so patriotic
    as the Liberal Unionists have been during the last five
    years.... Birmingham is the centre, the consecration of this

AIR--"_YE GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND_."[1]

  Ye Gentlemen of England,
    Who follow SALIS-BU-RY,
  How little did you count upon
    Assistance from J.C.!
  Give ear unto his speeches old,
    And they will plainly show
  Once he'd scorn to be borne
    Where the Tory breezes blow,
      Where the Lilies and Primroses bloom,
      And the Tory zephyrs blow.

  If once he did oppose you,
    To-day he is at war
  With GLADSTONE and his Items.
    Faith, JOE has travelled far!
  The Primrose Dames shall teach him
    True patriot "form" to know.
  He is leal, and will kneel
    To the "Lilies" in fair row;
      To the pretty, winsome Primrose girls,
      Who buttonhole Brum JOE.

  Ye Gentlemen of England,
    Whom once he did deride,
  How safe ye are, and how serene,
    With JOSEPH on your side.
  He talks no more of "Ransom"
    ('Tis P-e-n-s-i-o-n rather now),
  Brum JOE will not go
    Where the Hawarden winds do blow;
      Where HARCOURT thunders loud and long,
      And Gladstonians blare and blow.

  The Orchid from his button
    JOE's willing to displace,
  To take the Primrose posy
    That's proffered by Her Grace.
  O gentle dame and dainty,
    What man could answer "No!"
  As you prest to his breast
    The most blessed flowers that blow,
      The blossoms loved by BEACONSFIELD
      The bravest blooms that blow?

  O (Brummagem) Tory Beauty,
    'Tis yours to consecrate
  The holiest Alliance
    Our land hath seen of late.
  Shall he reject its symbol,
    Or answer "Not for JOE!"?
  Nay, sweet girl, such a churl
    Were no "Gentleman" you know;
      And JOE is "quite the Gentleman,"
      Brum BRUMMEL in full blow!

  Then courage, all brave Unionists,
    And never be afraid
  Whilst Brummagem Republican
    Is witched by Primrose Maid.
  There is soft fascination
    In radiant rank, we know;
  And a posy, though primrosy,
    From soft hands makes soft hearts glow,
      Lilies--though they toil not nor spin
      Are beauteous--in full blow!

LORD LYTTON.

BORN NOV. 8, 1831. DIED NOV. 24, 1891.

  Were clever wise, were grandiose great,
  How many a servant of the State
    Had left a more enduring name.
  But all is not for all; 'tis far
  From flaming meteor to fixed star,
    From notoriety to fame.

  Picturesque son of brilliant sire,
  It wanted but the touch of fire
    Prometheus only knows to bring
  The flame divine in him to wake
  Who moved our plaudits when he spake,
    But stirred no passion when he'd sing.

  The Orient pageantry he loved,
  The histrio not the hero moved,
    The _dilettante_ not the sage.
  Hence in our England's East his hand
  Turned, in a story sternly grand,
    A motley mock-heroic page.

  He by the Seine found fitter place
  For courtly wit and modish grace,
    Than by the Indus. There right well
  His facile talent served his Chief;
  And England hears with genuine grief
    That sudden-sounding passing bell.

  Of literary wares now hang on "prizes."

  Let us be frank, and call them _Lottery_ture!

SUITOR RESARTUS.

_A SENTIMENTAL DILEMMA._

[Illustration]

  How can I woo you in this ancient suit?
    You do not notice it, of course; I know it.
  My soul is burdened with a shapeless boot,
    Your heart is singing welcome to your poet.
  Here in the shadowy settle I can sit
    And sparkle with you, brightly confidential,
  But when into the lamp-bright zone you flit,
    I shrink into some corner penitential.
  A well-dressed crowd, their tailors all unpaid,
    Throng round you there, and cuffs and collars glisten;
  Of pity's blindness, as of scorn, afraid,
    I shun the merry fray, and darkling listen,
  For who could urge the timidest of suits,
    Conscious of such indifferent clothes and boots?

  You think me quite as good as other men;
    Nay, more, I think you think me vastly better;
  Your candid glances seem to ask me when
    I'll seek to bind you in a willing fetter.
  Is this presumption? Not from friend to friend,
    Whose souls unite like clasping hands of lovers;
  Yet can I breathe no word of love, to end
    The delicate doubt that o'er the unspoken hovers.
  If I were hopeless that you loved me not,
    My hopeless love, confess'd, myself would flatter,
  But should the blissful dream be true, I wot
    That love confess'd the joy of love would shatter.
  My Queen, indeed as king I'd love to lord it;
    I cannot tell you that I can't afford it.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATION:--"For many months nothing has been heard of
Lieutenant IVANITCH," was the remark of our leading journal _a propos_
of Russian disappearances. Is it not probable that IVANITCH, unable to
find a post to suit him, has gone on tour with a "scratch company"?

THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.

NO XVII.

    SCENE--_Under the Colonnade of the Hotel Grande Bretagne,
    Bellagio. CULCHARD is sitting by one of the pillars, engaged
    in constructing a sonnet. On a neighbouring seat a group of
    smart people are talking over their acquaintances, and near
    them is another visitor, a Mr. CRAWLEY STRUTT, who is
    watching his opportunity to strike into the conversation._

_Mrs. Hurlingham._ Well, she'll _be_ Lady CHESEPARE some day, when
anything happens to the old Earl. He was looking quite ghastly when we
were down at SKYMPINGS last. But they're frightfully badly off _now_,
poor dears! Lady DRIBLETT lets them have her house in Park Lane for
parties and that--but it's wonderful how they live at all!

[Illustration: "I don't know if you're acquainted with a paper called
the _Penny Patrician_?"]

_Colonel Sandown._ He looked pretty fit at the Rag the other day. Come
across the SENLACS anywhere? Thought Lady SENLAC was going abroad this
year.

_Mr. Crawley Strutt._ Hem--I saw it mentioned in the _Penny Patrician_
that her Ladyship had--

_Mrs. Hurl._ (_without taking the slightest notice of him_). She's
just been marryin' her daughter, you know--rather a good match, too.
Not what I call pretty,--smart-lookin', that's all. But then her
_sister_ wasn't pretty till she married.

_Col. Sand._ Nice family she married into! Met her father-in-law, old
Lord BLETHERHAM, the other morning, at a chemist's in Piccadilly--he'd
dropped in there for a pick-me-up; and there he was, tellin' chemist
all the troubles he'd had with his other sons marryin' the way they
did, and that. Rum man to go and confide in his chemist, but he's like
that--fond of the vine!

_Mr. C.S._ Er--er--it's becoming a very serious thing, Sir, the way
our aristocracy is deteriorating, is it not?

_Col. S._ Is it? What have they been up to now, eh? Haven't seen a
paper for days.

_Mr. C.S._ I mean these mixed marriages, and, well, their general
goings on, I don't know if you're acquainted with a paper called the
_Penny Patrician_? I take it in regularly, and I assure _you_--loyal
supporter of our old hereditary institutions as I am--some of the
revelations I read about in high life make me blush--yes, downright
_blush_ for them! [_Mrs. HURLINGHAM retires._

_Col. S._ Do they, though? If I were you I should let 'em do their own
blushin', and save my pennies.

_Mr. C.S._ (_deferentially_). No doubt you're right, Sir, but I _like_
the _Patrician_ myself--it's very smartly written. Talking of that,
do you happen to know the ins and outs of that marriage of young Lord
GOSLINGTON's? Something very mysterious about the party he's going to
marry--who _are_ her people now?

_Col. S._ Can't say, I'm sure--no business of mine, you know.

_Mr. C.S._ There I venture to think you're wrong, Sir. It's the
business of everybody--the _duty_, I may say--to see that the best
blood of the nation is not--(_Col. S. turns into the hotel; Mr. C.S.
sits down near CULCH._)--Remarkably superior set of visitors staying
here, Sir! My chief objection to travel always is, that it brings
you in contact with parties you wouldn't think of associating with at
home. I was making that same remark to a very pleasant little fellow
I met on the steamer--er--Lord UPPERSOLE, I think it was--and he
entirely concurred. Your friend made us acquainted.--(_PODBURY comes
out of the hotel._)--Ah, here _is_ your friend.--(_To PODB._)--Seen
his Lordship about lately, Sir?--Lord UPPERSOLE, I _mean_, of course!

_Podb._ UPPERSOLE? No--he's over at Cadenabbia, I believe.

_Mr. C.S._ A highly agreeable spot to stay at. Indeed, I've some idea
myself of--Exceedingly pleasant person his Lordship--so affable, so
completely the gentleman!

_Podb._ Oh, he's affable enough--for a boot-maker. I always give him a
title when I see him, for the joke of the thing--he likes it.

_Mr. C.S._ He _may_, Sir. I consider a title is not a thing to be
treated in that light manner. It--it was an unpardonable liberty to
force me into the society of that class of person--unpardonable, Sir!

    [_He goes._

_Podb._ Didn't take much _forcing_, after he once heard me call him
"Lord UPPERSOLE"! Where are all the others, eh? Thought we were going
up to the Villa Serbelloni this afternoon.

_Culch._ I--er--have not been consulted. Are they--er--_all_ going?

    [_With a shade of anxiety._

_Podb._ I believe so. You needn't be afraid, you know. HYPATIA won't
have the chance of ragging you now--she and Miss TROTTER have had a
bit of a breeze.

_Culch._ I rather gathered as much. I think I could guess the--

_Podb._ Yes, HYPATIA's rather uneasy about poor old BOB; thinks Miss
TROTTER is--well, carrying on, you know. She is no end of a little
flirt--_you_ know that well enough!--(_C. disclaims impatiently._)
Here you all are, eh?--(_To Miss P., Miss T., and BOB._)--Well, who
knows the way up to the villa?

_Miss T._ It's through the town, and up some steps by the church--you
cann't miss it. But Mr. PRENDERGAST is going to show me a short cut up
behind the hotel--aren't you, Mr. PRENDERGAST?

_Miss P._ (_icily_). I really think, dear, it would be better if we
all kept together--for so _many_ reasons!

_Culch._ (_with alacrity_). I agree with Miss PRENDERGAST. A short cut
is invariably the most indirect route.

_Miss P._ (_with intention_). You hear what Mr. CULCHARD says, my dear
MAUD? He advocates direct ways, as best in the long run.

_Miss T._ It's only going to be a short run, my love. But I'm vurry
glad to observe that you and Mr. CULCHARD are so perfectly harmonious,
as I'm leaving him on your hands for a spell. Aren't you ever coming,
Mr. PRENDERGAST?

    [_She leads him off, a not unwilling captive._

_A PATH IN THE GROUNDS OF THE VILLA SERBELLONI._

_Podb._ (_considerately, to CULCHARD, who is following Miss
PRENDERGAST and him, in acute misery_). Look here, old fellow, Miss
PRENDERGAST would like to sit down, I know; so don't you bother about
keeping with us if you'd rather _not_, you know!

    [_CULCHARD murmurs an inarticulate protest._

_Miss P._ Surely, Mr. PODBURY, you are aware by this time that Mr.
CULCHARD has a perfect mania for self-sacrifice!

    [_CULCHARD drops behind, crushed._

_AMONG THE RUINS AT THE TOP OF THE HILL._

_Culch._ (_who has managed to overtake Miss T. and her companion_).
Now _do_ oblige me by looking through that gap in the pines towards
Lecco. I particularly wish you to observe the effect of light on those
cliffs--it's well worth your while.

_Miss T._ Why, certainly, it's a view that does you infinite credit.
Oh, you _didn't_ take any hand in the arrangement? But ain't you
afraid if you go around patting the scenery on the head this way,
you'll have the lake overflow?

_Bob. P._ Ha-ha-ha! One in the eye for _you_, CULCHARD!

_Culch._ (_with dignity_). Surely one may express a natural enthusiasm
without laying oneself open--?

_Miss T._ Gracious, yes! I should hope you wouldn't want to show your
enthusiasm _that_ way--like a Japanese nobleman!

_Culch._ (_to himself_). Now that's coarse--_really_
coarse!--(_Aloud._)--I seem to be unable to open my mouth now without
some ridiculous distortion--

_Miss T._ My!--but that's a serious symptom--isn't it? You don't feel
like you were going to have lock-jaw, do you, Mr. CULCHARD?

    [_CULCHARD falls back to the rear once more. Later--Mr.
    VAN BOODELER has joined the party; HYPATIA has contrived
    to detach her brother, CULCHARD has sought refuge with
    PODBURY._

_Miss T._ (_to VAN B._). So that's what kept you? "Well, it sounds
just too enchanting. But I cann't answer for what Miss PRENDERGAST
will say to it. It mayn't suit her notions of propriety.

_Mr. Van B._ I expect she'll be superior to Britannic prejudices of
that kind. I consider your friend a highly cultivated and charming
lady, MAUD. She produces that impression upon me.

_Miss T._ I presume, from that, she has shown an intelligent interest
in the great American novel?

_Mr. Van B._ Why, yes; it enlists her literary sympathies--she sees
all its possibilities.

_Miss T._ And they're pretty numerous, too. But here she comes. You'd
better tell her your plan right now.

_Miss P._ (_in an earnest undertone to BOB, as they approach,
followed by CULCH. and BOB_). You _must_ try and be sensible about
it, BOB; if _you_ are too blind to see that she is only--

BOB (_sulkily_). All _right_! Haven't I _said_ I'd go? What's the good
of _jawing_ about it?

_Mr. V.B._ (_to Miss P._) I've been telling my cousin I've been
organising a little water-party for this evening--moonlight,
mandolins, Menaggio. If you find that alliteration has any
attractions, I hope you and your brother will do me the pleasure of--

_Miss P._ I'm afraid not, thanks. We have all our packing to do. We
find we shall have to leave early to-morrow.

    [_Van B.'s face falls; BOB listens gloomily to_ Miss T.'s
    rather perfunctory expressions of regret; PODBURY looks
    anxious and undecided; CULCHARD does his best to control an
    unseemly joy._

THE GOOD NEW "TIMES."

Nobody, after visiting Terry's Theatre, can apply to Mr. PINERO's
piece the hackneyed phrase,--used apologetically by an unconscionable
reader after detaining the leading journal for three-quarters of an
hour,--"Oh, there's nothing in _The Times_," for, in Mr. PINERO's
piece there is plenty of amusement, if not of absorbing interest.

[Illustration]

The story is that of a _parvenu_, whose sole object in life, to
be recognised by "Society," is thwarted by the marriage of his
good-for-nothing son with the daughter of an Irish lodging-house
keeper. The struggles of _Mr. and Mrs. Bompas_ to conceal this
_mesalliance_, and the assistance given them in their difficulties by
the _Hon. Montague Trimble_, constitute the motive of the play. But
the question that must occur to the critical mind is, "Did the author
mean this piece for high comedy, or farcical comedy?" If the former,
then Mr. TERRY is wrong in his conception of the part; if the latter,
everybody else is wrong in their conception of their parts.

It seems to me as if, in the course of rehearsal, the peculiarities
distinguishing the character of _Percy Egerton Bompas, M.P._, had
gradually become assimilated with the individualities of the actor,
Mr. EDWARD TERRY. If Mr. PINERO so meant it, if he so wrote it for Mr.
TERRY and for Mr. TERRY only, then there is nothing more to be said;
Mr. PINERO's ideal is realised. But if the author did _not_ intend Mr.
TERRY's impersonation, then he must be content to sacrifice the ideal
to the real, shrug his shoulders, and pocket his profits. Yet, as if
making an appeal to the public to judge between the auctorial abstract
and the representational concrete, Mr. PINERO not only publishes his
playbook, but sells it in the theatre. Visitors to TERRY's, who buy
the book, will judge the play by its stage interpretation that has had
the advantage of the author's personal supervision and direction. The
representation, therefore, is either more or less in accordance with
his teaching, or flatly contradicts it.

[Illustration: One of the Leaders in _The Times_.]

The publication of the book of a comedy in a theatre may be thankfully
received as a present help to the audience, and an aid to memory
afterwards, or it may be considered as a protest on the part of the
author who says, "Here's what I have written. See how they act it:
whether it be farce or comedy, judge for yourselves. You pay your
money, and you take your choice." Suffice it, then, to record that, on
the night of this deponent's visit, the piece played from eight till
past eleven, and that the audience from first to last was generally
amused, but, I should be inclined to say, particularly disappointed
at the collapse of Mr. TERRY's part in the last Act (the principal
portion of which he passes curled up on a sofa, with the top of
his forehead powdered white! Why?), and mystified by the sudden and
apparently unnecessary revelation, made by _Miss Cazalet_, to the
effect that _Lucy Tuck_ (a mentally and physically short-sighted girl)
is her illegitimate daughter; and these two last-named personages,
though essential to the plot, fail unfortunately in rousing any
sentiment of pity or of sympathy.

Mr. ELLIOT is excellent as the _Hon. Montague Trimble_; nothing
better, apart from Mr. HARE's eccentric characters, has been seen on
the stage for some considerable time. I hope the author is of the same
opinion. Mr. FRED THORNE is capital as the Irish Member; and as _Mrs.
Hooley_, an obtrusively Irish eccentricity of Thackerayan extraction,
Miss ALEXES LEIGHTON is very good, for the character, as drawn by
the author, _is_ obtrusive, and is so meant to be. The _Mrs. Egerton
Bompas_ of Miss FANNY BROUGH is _the_ woman to the life, and, in my
humble judgment, Miss BROUGH's impersonation is well-nigh faultless.
Whether, if the part of _Egerton Bompas_ were played as high comedy,
this would still improve Miss BROUGH's impersonation of _Mrs. Bompas_
or not, it is difficult to decide; but I am inclined to think this
would be the result. What does the author think? Most likely he will
continue to "think"; it is the wiser course. Mr. HENRY V. ESMOND makes
the lad, _Howard Bompas_, unnecessarily repulsive; but if, in doing
so, he is only exactly carrying out the author's idea, i.e., "Master's
orders," then he is no longer responsible for the overcharged
colouring. The probable fate of this unhappy pair, an impulsive
uneducated kind of Irish orange-girl married to a contemptible
young sot, is not a pleasant termination to the story, nor is the
anticipatory sadness felt for the future of this ill-assorted couple
in any way dissipated by the stereotyped and perfunctory offer of
marriage made by the young London Journal Nobleman to the daughter of
the utterly crushed snob just before the Curtain descends.

Why the piece is called _The Times_, remains a mystery. _To-day_
would have been better; that is, if by _The Times_ is only meant "The
Present Day." And if it doesn't mean this, what meaning has it? For
alliterative advertisement it may be useful; e.g., "Times at TERRY's."
The dialogue generally is easy, natural and telling.

    [At the meeting (at Birmingham) of the National Union of
    Conservative and Constitutional Associations, a resolution in
    favour of "considering the claims of women to be admitted to
    the franchise when entitled by ownership or occupation," was
    carried "by an overwhelming majority, amid loud cheers."
    Mrs. FAWCETT afterwards said, "What new forces were they (the
    Conservative Party) prepared to bring against the anarchy,
    socialism and revolution which were arrayed against them?
    The granting of women's suffrage would be against the
    disintegrating power of the other side, as women were
    everywhere anti-revolutionary forces.... This would add
    about 800,000 to the electorate. They would be, she believed,
    middle-aged women of property, than whom she thought they
    could not assemble more anti-revolutionary forces."]

SALISBURY's first speech at Birmingham. It was intended to come in
at the passage where the PREMIER boldly flouted apprehension, of
Ministerial disaster at the General Election. He had meant to cite Mr.
JACKSON's appointment as conclusive proof that the Government would
exist at least up to the year 1900.

"SHAKSPEARE," he should have said, "has written, 'a tanner will last
you nine year,' and of course the duration of the Government will
be co-incidental with the prolongation of the term of our Financial
Secretary to the Treasury, withdrawn from commercial pursuits at
Leeds."

HERR VON DER BLOWITZOWN-TROMP has some interesting reminiscences of
the lamented Baron MAC HINERY. "When he was appointed Legate at the
Court of the Isle of Man," writes the great historian of our times,
"he dined with me in passing through Nanterre. It was the very day the
Marquis DE MOULIN had been elected Pompier. The other guests were,
His Excellency the CON OF CRIM TARTARY, Prince ALLEZ-VOUS-EN, His
Excellency the VICUNA of BRAZIL, the SANDWICH AMBASSADOR, the DOGE of
VENICE, and the Baron MUNCHAUSEN, who was a kind of amateur partner of
mine, in whom I had much confidence--I always left him with my day's
correspondence ready to be committed to paper. In the course of the
dinner a stupid _garcon_, handing the ice round, dropped a small piece
down the back of the neck of the DOGE of VENICE. With great presence
of mind Baron MUNCHAUSEN seized the poker (which fortunately happened
to be in the fire), and, with inimitable dexterity, passed the red-hot
brand between the DOGE's shirt-collar and his neck, and, deftly
touching the piece of ice, melted it. It was an awkward moment. The
canned lobster was just served, but no one thought of eating it. The
CON of CRIM TARTARY turning to Baron MAC HINERY, said,--

"You, my Lord, who are disinterested in this matter, tell us what you
think of it."

"I think," replied the Baron, with admirable _sangfroid_, "his
Highness the DOGE would have felt better if the ice had been warmer,
and the poker cooler."

Everybody laughed. The DOGE and Baron MUNCHAUSEN shook hands, and the
dinner ended gaily.

RYMOND, writing _lui-meme_ with too infrequent pen, makes pathetic
reference to the death of "one of the largest and best known purveyors
of Rhine wine, with whom I have had business relations and personal
intercourse for nearly thirty years." There is, we need hardly say,
no basis for the insinuation thrown out by HENED that the business
relations referred to were of the commission order sometimes
established between purveyors of Rhine and other wines and gentlemen
who have a wide circle of friends.

THEORY AND PRACTICE.

    SCENE--_Interior of a First-class Railway Carriage.
    Theoretical Passenger and Practical Passenger discussing the
    "Unreadiness of England."_

_Theoretical Passenger_ (_at the conclusion of a long account of the
national shortcomings_). Yes, my dear Sir, France has only to declare
war to-morrow, and we are completely ruined! We cease to exist as a
nation!

_Practical Passenger_ (_with a smile_). But hasn't this been said
about us--by ourselves--for any number of years?

_Theo. Pas._ Doubtless, but that does not make it the less true.

_Prac. Pas._ Possibly; still, it is encouraging to find that we _do_
exist in spite of the "temptation to belong to other nations."

_Theo. Pas._ (_annoyed_). Ah! you treat the matter with levity; but
I assure you it is a most serious thing! How would you like to be
bombarded?

_Prac. Pas._ Not at all. The more especially as it would be a great
expense to the enemy.

_Theo. Pas._ (_with dignified resentment_). I see you consider the
subject a proper topic for raillery! It is a very fine day!

_Prac. Pas._ (_in a conciliatory tone_). No, no, I can assure you I am
deeply interested. But how about our Fleet--surely that should protect
us?

_Theo. Pas._ You must be very much behind the age to say so. Our Fleet
is practically valueless. It is perfectly easy to invade us at a
dozen places. If the French went to Ireland (as they did in the last
century), the conquest of England would be assured. They would (with
the assistance of a friendly peasantry), get their supplies and make
good their footing.

_Prac. Pas._ But how about our Army?

_Theo. Pas._ A farce! An expensive farce. We have no Regulars, the
Militia exists only on paper, and the Volunteers are valueless.

_Prac. Pas._ Then why not have a Conscription--that would bring up our
Army with a run?

_Theo. Pas._ A Conscription! My dear Sir, the nation wouldn't think of
such a thing! No, not for a single moment!

_Prac. Pas._ (_after a pause_). Well, what is to be done?

_Theo. Pas._ (_promptly_). Nothing, except to write to the papers and
submit to our fate.

_Prac. Pas._ Is there any objection to the construction of the Channel
Tunnel?

_Theo. Pas._ (_carelessly_). None in the least--but why do you ask?

_Prac. Pas._ Because, if in the case of war, the entire French nation
pours into England;--as you say it will?

_Theo. Pas._ Certainly.

_Prac. Pas._ The best thing we can do is to utilise the Tunnel, pour
into France, and stay there! It will be only changing sides!

  "I _can't_," he replied, "or I would, darling, quick!

  You'll perhaps set _me_ off," said the Stick to the Sphinx.
  "Nay, long 'inhibition,'" the Sphinx made reply,
  "Has imparted rigidity, love, to my eye."
  "'Emotional movement' no longer is mine,"
  Sighed the Stick to the Sphinx; "though I greatly incline
  To a dig in your ribs, or a slap on your back
  (As a sign of my love), all my muscles are slack.
  My poor 'motor-centres' are all out of gear,
  And I can't even 'chuck' your soft chin, sweet, I fear.
  I'm sure such a stolid inflexible 'stick' you'll hate,
  But, though I adore you, I _cannot_ gesticulate--"
  "My case is as bad," sighed the Sphinx to the Stick,
  "For I cannot 'bridle'--no more than a brick."
  Said the Stick to the Sphinx, "Ah, we once knew what love meant!
  But, thanks to the loss of 'emotional movement,'
  We can't give it 'graceful and chastened expression,'
  And so it seems slipping fast out of possession.
  Heigho! we had far better die, darling, quick!

"ON THE HYP"-NOTIST.

(_FRAGMENT FROM A ROMANCE PURELY IMAGINARY AND YET TO BE WRITTEN._)

The _Savants_ were gathered together to consider the question of
Hypnotism. They had been appointed by a learned Association, and their
Hon. Secretary had distinguished himself by writing a letter, which if
eccentric in punctuation, was yet to the point.

"We must not forget, Gentlemen," said one of the learned persons,
"that we have been appointed to investigate the use of Hypnotism as
a therapeutic agent. It will be our duty to ascertain, if it is
possible, that operations can be performed under the shield of its
anaesthesia."

"You are indeed right," replied another, "and it is fortunate in one
sense that we have not had the advantage of greeting at our board,
Doctor OWEN COLEMAN of Dunedin, Surbiton."

"Why so?" asked a third.

"Because," returned _Savant_ No. 2, "that distinguished Member of the
Medical Profession can give instances of successful treatment under
the prescribed circumstances. For instance, JULES CLOQUET, as early
as 1845 was using Hypnotism in the cause of painless surgery. However,
our pleasant little gathering can do no harm."

"Perhaps not," acquiesced _Savant_ No. 3. "Although it is only right
to remark that had we had Dr. COLEMAN's knowledge, we should have
possibly considered it _qua_ Committee a trifle superfluous."

"Do you not think we ought to visit the Aquarium?" asked the first
speaker. "I am told that there is a Hypnotist who appears there twice
a-day, and whose exhibition, from a scientific point of view, should
be decidedly interesting."

After this there was a speedy departure, and for some hours the
Committee lounged about the Aquarium, They there saw a female acrobat
of great strength. Then they paid a visit to the Alhambra, where they
met a pleasant young lady, who, seemingly without any assistance,
lifted four or five bulky gentlemen seated on a chair. This she did
without any exertion and with a smiling countenance. On their return
to their private room, they seemed somewhat hostile to the pretensions
of the Hypnotist, whose feats they had just witnessed--they preferred
to his performances the feats of the Magnetic Lady.

[Illustration]

"Quite a mistake," said one; "instead of taking off a leg, or showing
the strength of a billiard cue, he makes men believe that they are
swimming in a tank!"

"Very undignified," remarked another; "it would have been so much
better had he performed a surgical operation--say, setting a compound
fracture of the leg, like that performed by two medical men in 1845;
and more interesting to the vast majority of the audience."

"But the Alhambra was excellent," was the reply. "Suppose we send
to our Committee a Report of the 'Magnetic Lady' and ignore the
Hypnotist?"

And so it was decided, and it was time to write their Report. Then
pens, ink, and paper were produced, and the _Savants_ prepared for
work. They had scarcely commenced, when a gentleman stood in their
midst, and glared at them. He gave them each a disc, and commanded
them to gaze upon its surface. Then, one by one, they fell over fast
asleep. He placed them back in their chairs.

"Now for your Report," he murmured. "And so you would ignore _my_
show and praise another! But you are in my power, and _shall_ obey
me! Write what I dictate!" And so they wrote. And, strange as it may
appear to non-believers in Hypnotism, the Report, when published,
was found to be an excellent advertisement for the Royal Westminster
Aquarium!

NO. III.--THE SPOOKS IN THE SQUARE.

AIR--"_THE GOBLINS IN THE CHURCHYARD_."

  I went down to the Psychical Society one night,
  And heard them talk of Spooks and things that filled me with affright.
  The Psychical Society, as every member boasts,
  Was founded with the object of investigating Ghosts!
  Now Ghosts, the modern species, are of very various sorts,
  For like some plants, as botanists say, they seem to run to "sports."
  I used to think a spectre _was_ a spectre, but I find
  The "Psychical" can furnish Spooks of every class and kind.

_CHORUS._

[Illustration]

  Some of the Ghosts are little, some of the Ghosts are big,
  Some come in the guise of a headless man, and some of a spectre pig.
  Some of them laugh "Ha! ha!" Some of them wail "Heigho!"
  And I felt that night in a doose of a fright before it was time to go.

  I had read _Phantasmagoria_ by that writer quaint but grand,
  Who penned _The Hunting of the Snark_ and _Alice in Wonderland_.
  And I thought I knew a thing or two, or might be even three,
  About a Ghoul, and a Fay or Troll, and a Brownie or Banshee.
  I knew that a Banshee always howled, whilst a Goblin might but yawn,
  I also knew that a Poltergeist was _not_ a Leprechaun,
  But the Psychicals, I'm bound to say, had me on "buttered toastes"
  With the wonderful changes which they rang on the good old Churchyard
      "Ghostes."

_CHORUS._

  Some of their Ghosts were sages, some of them seemed sheer noddies;
  Some of the same like a "Wandering Flame," and others as "Astral
      Bodies."
  Some of theirs croaked "Ha! ha!" some of them chuckled "Ho! ho!"
  And I got so sad, I was heartily glad when I found it was time to go.

  I dropped into the "Rose and Crown," a highly respectable tavern,
  For Ghosts are dry, and my thirst was high, my throat like a chalky
      cavern.
  I didn't have much, only four of cold Scotch, which is good to moisten
      chalk.
  The night was fine, it was twelve twenty-nine, so I thought I might
      just as well walk.
  But when I entered Trafalgar Square, I heard a mysterious sound;
  There was not even a Bobby in sight as I stole a glance around;
  But seated on NELSON's lions four, and perched on the neighbouring
      "posteses,"
  I saw, as we said in our Nursery Rhyme, a dozen or so of "Ghosteses"!

_CHORUS._

  Some of the Ghosts were short, some of the Ghosts were tall,
  Some of them had most preposterous noddles, and some of them none at all,
  They all gave a shrill "Ha! ha!" they all gave a hushed "Ho! ho!"
  I turned in a fright and I wished 'em good night--but they would not let
      me go!

  Then one of the Ghosts began to speak; down on my knees I sank,
  "I am a Nobleman's Ghost," said he, "and mine offence is Rank!
  I never cared for the Common Herd, the People I loved to crush;
  My only remark on the Poor was 'Pooh!' my retort to the Toilers 'Tush!'
  And if they dared to grumble, why, I used to raise my rents,
  For I always held that the Mob were made to keep up the Cent-per-cents,
  And now in this Square I hear BURNS's blare, see the Red Banner wave,
  And Society swished by the Socialist; so I cannot rest in my grave."

_CHORUS._

  Another Ghost commenced. He said: "I was a great R.A.
  (I remember the time when we used to meet in "the pepper-pots," over
      the way),
  My daubs were always hung on the line, for ourselves we used to judge,
  Our sole Ideal conventional cant, our _technique_ broad brown smudge.
  And now BURNE JONES's pictures _sell_!!!"--here he writhed with a
      spectral twist--
  "And our 'broad brown smudge' gives way to the fudge cranks call
      'Impressionist.'
  I've lost my head, as perhaps you mark--though I keep a ventriloquist
      tongue.
  What's the use of a head to an Artist Ghost, who has never a chance
      to be hung?"

_CHORUS_--SOME OF THE GHOSTS, &C.

  A Lawyer's Ghost wept on his post, and then began to state
  That the Revolution of Sixty-eight--he meant of Six-_and_-eight--
  For the abolition of needless fees, and the stopping of useless jaw,
  Had capped the murder of Privilege by the massacre of Law:
  Order, this Spook went on to state, was the prey of police--less prank,
  All the real jam of life was lost with the abolition of Rank.
  Here he wept! Ah! _can_ there be a sight a pitiful breast to thrill
  Like the Ghost of a Lawyer dropping a tear o'er the Ghost of a
      Lawyer's Bill?

_CHORUS_--SOME OF THE GHOSTS, &C.

  I woke. A pain possessed my head. The gathered Ghosts were gone,
  And I lay there in Trafalgar Square, on a cold stone alone.
  I seemed to hear a wailing cry, a whisper on the breeze,
  Which said, in accents I well knew, "_Now then, Time, Gentlemen,
      please_!"
  It may have been the warning to recall those vagrant Ghosts
  To ---- wheresoever they abide, poor pallid spectral hosts!
  What it all meant I cannot tell, but this at least I know,
  To that Psychical Society no more at night I'll go!

_CHORUS._

  Some of the Ghosts did goggle, some of the Spooks did stare,
  But there they sat in a spectral row round "the Squirts" in Trafalgar
      Square.
  They all gave a loud "Ha! ha!" they all gave a loud "Ho! ho!"
  And I turned and fled, and got home to bed as the rooster began to crow!

THE NAKED TRUTH.--Our old friend, Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM, was reading, the
other day, a letter in the _Times_ about "Electrical Tramways," when
she came upon a line stating that "two naked conductors" would be
used. Much shocked, she was about to look at something else in the
paper when she noticed that "one of the conductors was to be carried
on poles," and another to be "laid rigid between the rails!" Horrified
at this apparent brutality, the worthy lady has been writing letters
(in draft) to the Commissioner of Police ever since!

A FRIENDLY TIP TO THE FIGHTING FACTIONS.

  Recrimination is vexation,
    Sedition is as bad;
  Home Rule the-o-ry much puzzles J.B.
    _Such_ practice proves _you_ mad!

       *       *       *       *       *

A TIMELY SUGGESTION.--Commenting upon the exceptionally bad
case of the Rev. Mr. CLUTTERBUCK last week, the _Times_ asks if
something cannot be done to put down betting by turf-agencies, and
stock-exchange gambling per "bucket-shops." We regret our inability to
suggest an immediate remedy, but, as a warning and a reminder, let the
last-named institutions be called "Clutterbucket-shops."

       *       *       *       *       *

NOTICE.--Rejected Communications or Contributions, whether MS.,
Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any description, will in no
case be returned, not even when accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed
Envelope, Cover, or Wrapper. To this rule there will be no exception.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
