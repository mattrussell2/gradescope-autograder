EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.


We think that the present number, both in its pictorial and its literary
contents, will please our host of readers, young and old. The charming
little story of "The Little Culprit," in its mixture of humor and
pathos, has been rarely excelled.

The drawing lessons, consisting of outlines made by Weir from Landseer's
pictures, seem to be fully appreciated by our young readers, and we have
received from them several copies which are very creditable.

Remember that for teaching children to read there are no more attractive
volumes than "The Easy Book" and "The Beautiful Book," published at this
office.

The pleasant days of spring ought to remind canvassers that now is a
good time for getting subscribers, and that "The Nursery" needs but to
be shown to intelligent parents to be appreciated. See terms.

The use of "The Nursery" in schools has been attended with the best
results. We have much interesting testimony on this point, which we may
soon communicate. It will be worthy the attention of teachers and school
committees.

Subscribers who do not receive "THE NURSERY" promptly, (making due
allowance for the ordinary delay of the mail), are requested to notify
us IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait two or three months and then write
informing us that we have "not sent" the magazine, (which in most cases
is not the fact): but state simply that you have not RECEIVED it; and
be sure, in the first place, that the fault is not at your own
Post-office. Always mention the DATE of your remittance and
subscription as nearly as possible. Remember that WE are not
responsible for the short-comings of the Post-office, and that our
delivery of the magazine is complete when we drop it into the Boston
office properly directed.

"Every house that has children in it, needs 'The Nursery' for their
profit and delight: and every childless house needs it for the sweet
portraiture it gives of childhood."--Northampton Journal.

THE DOG WHO LOST HIS MASTER


Spot was a little dog who had come all the way from Chicago to Boston,
in the cars with his master. But, as they were about to take the cars
back to their home, they entered a shop near the railroad-station; and
there, before Spot could get out to follow his master, a bad boy shut
the door, and kept the poor dog a prisoner.

The cars were just going to start. In vain did the master call "Spot,
Spot!" In vain did poor Spot bark and whine, and scratch at the door,
and plead to be let out of the shop. The bad boy kept him there till
just as the bell rang; and then he opened the door, and poor Spot
ran--oh, so fast!--but the cars moved faster than he.

Mile after mile poor Spot followed the cars, till they were far out of
sight. Then, panting and tired, he stopped by the roadside, and wondered
what he should do, without a home, without a master.

He had not rested many minutes, when he saw two little girls coming
along the road that crossed the iron track. They were Nelly and Julia,
two sisters. Spot thought he would try and make friends with them.

But they were afraid of strange dogs. Julia began to cry; and Nelly
said, "Go away, sir; go home, sir: we don't want any thing to do with
you, sir."

Spot was sorry to be thus driven off. He stopped, and began to whine in
a pleading sort of way, as if saying, "I am a good dog, though a
stranger to you. I have lost my master, and I am very hungry. Please let
me follow you. I'll be very good. I know tricks that will please you."

The children were not so much afraid when they saw him stop as if to get
permission to follow. "He is a good dog, after all," said Nelly: "he
would not force his company on us; he wants his dinner. Come on, sir!"

Thus encouraged, Spot ran up, wagging his tail, and showing that he was
very glad to find a friend. He barked at other dogs who came too near,
and showed that he meant to defend the little girls at all risks.

When they arrived home, they gave him some milk and bread, and then took
him into the sitting-room, and played with him. "Beg, sir!" said Nelly;
and at once Spot stood upright on his hind-legs, and put out his
fore-paws.

Then Julia rolled a ball along the floor; and Spot caught it almost
before it left her hand. "Now, die, sir, die!" cried Nelly; and, much to
her surprise, Spot lay down on the floor, and acted as if he were dead.

When papa came home, and saw what a good, wise dog Spot was, he told the
children they might keep him till they could find the owner.

A week afterwards, they saw at the railroad-station a printed bill
offering a reward of thirty dollars for Spot.

He was restored at once to his master, who proved to be a Mr. Walldorf,
a German. But the little girls refused the offered reward; for they said
they did not deserve it, and Spot had been no trouble to them.

Three weeks passed by, and then there came a box from New York, directed
to Nelly and Julia. They opened it: and there were two beautiful French
dolls, and two nice large dolls' trunks filled with dolls' dresses and
bonnets,--dresses for morning and evening, for opera and ball-room, for
the street and the parlor, for riding and walking.

The present was from Mr. Walldorf; and with it came a letter from him
thanking the little girls for their kindness to his good dog, Spot, and
promising to bring Spot to see them the next time he visited Boston.

ON A HIGH HORSE.


    On a velocipede
      Harry would ride:
    Quickly the splendid steed
      Set him astride.

    Now for a jolly time!
      Now for some sport!
    Hold on!--the little chap's
      Legs are too short.

    Harry can't touch the peg,
      All he can do;
    Though he may stretch his leg
      Out of his shoe!

    What can we do for him?
      This much, of course:
    Let down the rider--or
      Let down the horse.

    Many a hobby-horse
      Small boys must ride,
    Ere such a steed as this
      They can bestride

    So, little Harry dear,
      Don't look so cross
    When you are taken down
      From a high horse.

CELEBRATING GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.


There were three little sisters and one little brother; and their names
were Emma, Ruth, Linda, and John. And these children had a grandmother,
whose seventieth birthday was near at hand.

"What shall we do to celebrate our dear grandmother's birthday?" asked
Emma, the eldest.

"Get some crackers and torpedoes, and fire them off," said Johnny.

"Oh, that will never do!" cried Linda. "Let us give her a serenade."

"But we none of us sing well enough," said Ruth; "and grandmother, you
know, is a very good musician. Let us do this: Let us come to her as the
'Four Seasons,' and each one salute her with a verse."

"Yes: that's a very pretty idea," cried Linda. "And I'll be Spring; for
they say my eyes are blue as violets."

"Then I'll be Summer," cried Emma. "I like summer best."

"I'll be Autumn," said Johnny; "for, if there's any thing I like, it is
grapes. Peaches, too, are not bad; and what fun it is to go a-nutting!"

"There's but one season left for me," said Ruth. "I must be Winter. No
matter! Winter has its joys as well as the rest."

"But who'll write the verses for us?" asked Emma. "There must be a verse
for every season."

"Oh, the teacher will write them for us!" cried Ruth. "No one could do
it better."

And so, on the morning of grandmother's birthday, as she sat in her
large armchair, with her own pussy on a stool at her side, the "Four
Seasons" entered the room, one after another, and formed a semicircle
in front of her. Grandmother was not a bit frightened. She smiled
kindly; and then the "Seasons" spoke as follows:--

[Illustration: Celebrating Grandmother's Birthday]


SPRING.

    I am the Spring: with sunshine see me coming;
    Birds begin to twitter; hark! the bees are humming:
    Green to field and hillside, blossoms to the tree,
    Joy to every human heart are what I bring with me.


SUMMER.

    See my wealth of flowers! I'm the golden Summer:
    Is there for the young or old a more welcome comer?
    Come and scent the new-mown grass; by the hillside stray;
    And confess that only June brings the perfect day.


AUTUMN.

    Mark the wreath about my head,--wreath of richest flowers;
    I am Autumn, and I bring mildest, happiest hours;
    In my hand a goblet see, which the grape-juice holds;
    Corn and grain and precious fruits, Autumn's arm enfolds.


WINTER.

    Round my head the holly-leaf; in my hand the pine:
    I am Winter cold and stern; these last flowers are mine.
    But while I am left to rule, all's not dark or sad;
    Christmas comes with winter-time to make the children glad.


ALL THE SEASONS.

    Here our offerings glad we bring,
    And long life to Grandma sing.

THE LITTLE CULPRIT.


School had begun. The boys and girls were in their places, and the
master was hearing them spell; when all at once there was a soft, low
knock at the door.

"Come in!" said the master; and a little cleanly-dressed girl, about six
years old, stood upon the threshold, with downcast eyes.

She held out before her, as if trying to hide behind it, a satchel, so
large that it seemed hard to decide whether the child had brought it, or
it had brought the child; and the drops on her cheeks showed how she had
been running.

"Why, Katie!" cried the schoolmaster, "why do you come so late? Come
here to me, little culprit. It is the first time you have been late.
What does it mean?"

Little Katie slowly approached him, while her chubby face grew scarlet.
"I--I had to pick berries," she faltered, biting her berry-stained lips.

"O Katie!" said the master, raising his forefinger, "that is very
strange. You _had_ to? Who, then, told you to?"

Katie still looked down; and her face grew redder still.

"Look me in the face, my child," said the master gravely. "Are you
telling the truth?"

Katie tried to raise her brown roguish eyes to his face: but, ah! the
consciousness of guilt weighed down her eyelids like lead. She could not
look at her teacher: she only shook her curly head.

"Katie," said the master kindly, "you were not sent to pick berries: you
ran into the woods to pick them for yourself. Perhaps this is your first
falsehood, as it is the first time you have been late at school. Pray
God that it may be your last."

"Oh, oh!" broke forth the little culprit, "the neighbor's boy, Fritz,
took me with him; and the berries tasted so good that I staid too long."

[Illustration: At Teacher's Desk]

The other children laughed; but a motion of the master's hand restored
silence, and, turning to Katie, he said, "Now, my child, for your
tardiness you will have a black mark, and go down one in your class;
but, Katie, for the falsehood you will lose your place in my heart, and
I cannot love you so much. But I will forgive you, if you will go stand
in the corner of your own accord. Which will you do,--lose your place in
my heart, or go stand in the corner for a quarter of an hour?"

The child burst into a flood of tears, and sobbing out, "I'd rather go
stand in the corner," went there instantly, and turned her dear little
face to the wall.

In a few minutes the master called her, and, as she came running to him,
he said: "Will you promise me, Katie, never again to say what is not
true?"

"Oh, yes, I will try--I will try never, never to do it again," was the
contrite answer.

Then the master took up the rosy little thing, and set her on his knee,
and said: "Now, my dear child, I will love you dearly. And, if you are
ever tempted to say what is not true, think how it would grieve your old
teacher if he knew it, and speak the truth for his sake."

"Yes, yes!" cried the child, her little heart overflowing with
repentance; and, throwing her arms around the master's neck, she hugged
him, and said again, "Yes, yes!"

THE DOLL-BABY SHOW.


    Our doll-baby show, it was something quite grand;
    You saw there the loveliest dolls in the land.
    Each girl brought her own, in its prettiest dress:
    Three pins bought a ticket, and not a pin less.

    For the doll that was choicest we offered a prize:
    There were wee mites of dollies, and some of great size.
    Some came in rich purple, some lilac, some white,
    With ribbons and laces,--a wonderful sight!

    Now, there was one dolly, so tall and so proud,
    She put all the others quite under a cloud;
    But one of us hinted, in so many words,
    That sometimes fine feathers do not make fine birds.

[Illustration: The Doll-Baby Show]

    We sat in a row, with our dolls in our laps:
    The dolls behaved sweetly, and met no mishaps.
    No boys were admitted; for boys will make fun:
    Now which do you think was the dolly that won?

    Soon all was commotion to hear who would get
    The prize; for the dollies' committee had met:
    We were the committee; and which do you think
    Was the doll we decided on, all in a wink?

    Why, each of us said that our own was the best,
    The finest, the sweetest, the prettiest drest:
    So we _all_ got the prize--we'll invite you to go
    The next time we girls have our doll-baby show.

THE CHICKENS THAT WERE WISER THAN LOTTIE.


Lottie is always asking, "Why?"

When mamma calls from the window, "Lottie, Lottie!" she answers, very
pleasantly, "What, ma'am?" for she hopes mamma will say, "Here's a nice
turnover for you;" or, "Cousin Alice has come to see you." But when the
answer is "It is time to come in," the wrinkles appear on Lottie's
forehead, and her voice is a very different one, as she says, "Oh, dear,
I don't want to! _Why_ need I come in now?"

When papa says, "Little daughter, I want you to do an errand for me,"
Lottie whines, and asks, "_Why_ can't Benny do it?"

Out in the field Old Biddy Brown has four wee chickens, little soft
downy balls, scarcely bigger than the eggs they came from just one week
ago.

They are very spry, and run all about. When the mother Biddy finds any
nice bit, she clucks; and every little chick comes running to see what
is wanting.

When it grows chilly, and she fears they will take cold, she says,
"Cluck, cluck, cluck!" and they all run under her warm feathers as fast
as they can.

Just now Mother Biddy gave a very loud call, and every chicken was under
her wings in a minute; and up in the sky I saw a hawk, who had been
planning to make a good dinner of these same chickens. I could not help
thinking, how well for them, that they did not stop, like Lottie, to
ask, "Why?"

Down came the hawk with a fierce swoop, as if he meant to take the old
hen and the chickens too; but Mother Biddy sprang up and faced him so
boldly, that he did not know what to make of it.

[Illustration: The Chickens That Were Wiser Than Lottie]

She seemed to say, "Come on my fine fellow, if you dare. You have got to
eat me before you eat my chicks; and you'll find me rather tough."

So the hawk changed his mind at the last moment. He thought he would
wait till he could catch the chickens alone. The chickens were saved,
though one of them was nearly dead with fright.

A HUNT FOR BOY BLUE.


We have a little three-year-old boy at our house, who likes to hear
stories, and his mother tells him a great many. But there is one which
pleases him more than all the rest, and perhaps the little readers of
"The Nursery" will like it too.

You have all heard of little Boy Blue, and how he was called upon to
blow his horn; but I don't think any of you know what a search his
father had to find him. This is the story.

Boy Blue lived on a large farm, and took care of the sheep and cows. One
day the cows got into the corn, and the sheep into the meadow; and Boy
Blue was nowhere to be seen. His father called and called, "Boy Blue,
Boy Blue, where are you? Why do you not look after the sheep and cows?
Where are you?" But no one answered.

[Illustration: Father & Horse]

Then Boy Blue's father went to the pasture, and said, "Horse, horse,
have you seen Boy Blue?" The old horse pricked up his cars, and looked
very thoughtful, but neighed, and said, "No, no: I have not seen Boy
Blue."

[Illustration: Father & Oxen]

Next he went to the field where the oxen were ploughing, and said,
"Oxen, oxen, have you seen Boy Blue?" They rolled their great eyes, and
looked at him; but shook their heads, and said, "No, no: we have not
seen Boy Blue."

[Illustration: Father & Duck]

Next, he went to the pond; and a great fat duck came out to meet him;
and he said, "Duck, duck, have you seen Boy Blue?" And she said, "Quack,
quack, quack! I have not seen Boy Blue." And all the other ducks said,
"Quack, quack!"

[Illustration: Father & Turkey]

Then Boy Blue's father visited the turkeys, and asked the old gobbler if
he had seen Boy Blue. The old gobbler strutted up and down, saying,
"Gobble, gobble, gobble! I have not seen Boy Blue."

[Illustration: Cockerel]

He then asked the cockerel if he had seen Boy Blue. And the cockerel
answered, "Cock-coo-doodle-doo! I haven't seen Boy Blue:
cock-coo-doodle-doo!"

[Illustration: Hen]

Then an old hen was asked if she had seen Boy Blue. She said, "Cluck,
cluck, cluck! I haven't seen Boy Blue; but I will call my chicks, and
you can ask them. Cluck, cluck, cluck!" And all the chicks came running,
but only said, "Peep, peep, peep! We haven't seen Boy Blue. Peep, peep,
peep!"

[Illustration: Hen & Chicks]

Boy Blue's father then went to the men who were making hay, and said,
"Men, men, have you seen my Boy Blue?" But the men answered, "No, no: we
have not seen Boy Blue." But just then they happened to look under a
haycock; and there, all curled up, lay Boy Blue, and his dog Tray, fast
asleep.

[Illustration: Father & Boy Blue]

His father shook him by the arm, saying, "Boy Blue, wake up, wake up!
The sheep are in the meadow, and the cows are in the corn." Boy Blue
sprang to his feet, seized his tin horn, and ran as fast as he could to
the cornfield, with his little dog running by his side.

[Illustration: Boy Blue & Horn]

He blew on his horn, "_Toot, toot, toot_!" and all the cows came running
up, saying, "Moo, moo!" He drove them to the barn to be milked. Then he
ran to the meadows, and blew once more, "_Toot, toot, toot_!" and all
the sheep came running up, saying, "Baa, baa!" and he drove them to
their pasture.

Then Boy Blue said to his dog, "Little dog, little dog, it's time for
supper," and his little dog said "Bow, wow! Bow, wow!" So they went home
to supper.

After Boy Blue had eaten a nice bowl of bread and milk, his father said:
"Now Boy Blue, you had better go to bed, and have a good night's rest,
so that you may be able to keep awake all day to-morrow; for I don't
want to have such a hunt for you again." Then Boy Blue said, "Good
night," and went to bed, and slept sweetly all night long.

DAY AND NIGHT.


Blue-eyed Charley Day had a cousin near his own age, whose name was
Harry Knight. When they were about eight years old, and began to go to
the public school, the boys called them, "Day and Night."

Charley did not object to the puns the schoolboys made; but Harry was
quite vexed by them. Having quite a dark skin, and very dark eyes and
hair, he thought the boys meant to insult him by calling him, "Night."

One large boy, about twelve years old, seemed to delight in teasing
Harry. He would say to him, "Come here, 'Night,' and shade my eyes, the
day is so bright." Then, seeing that Harry was annoyed, he would say,
"Oh, what a dark night!"

Poor Harry would get angry, and that made matters worse; for then Tom
Smith would call him a "stormy night," or a "cloudy night," or the
"blackest night" he ever saw.

Harry talked with his mother about it; and she told him the best way
would be to join with the boys in their jokes, or else not notice them
at all. She said if he never got out of temper, the boys would not call
him any thing worse than a "bright starry night." And if he went through
the world with as good a name as that she should be perfectly satisfied.

"Don't take offence at trifles, Harry," said Mrs. Knight. "Don't be
teased by a little nonsense. All the fun that the boys can make out of
your name will not hurt you a bit."

Harry was wise enough to do as his mother advised, and he found that she
was right. The boys soon became tired of their jokes, when they found
that no one was disturbed by them. But the little cousins were alway
good-naturedly called "Day and Night."

VIEW FROM COOPER'S HILL.


When grandma was a little girl, she lived in England, where she was
born. She lived in the town of Windsor, twenty-three miles south-west of
London, the greatest city in the world.

Grandma showed us, the other day, this picture of a view from Cooper's
Hill, near Windsor, and said, "Many a time and oft, dear children, have
I stood there by the old fence, and looked down on the beautiful
prospect,--the winding Thames, the gardens, the fields, and Windsor
Castle in the distance.

"This noble structure was originally built by William the Conqueror, as
far back as the eleventh century. It has been embellished by most of the
succeeding kings and queens. It is the principal residence of Queen
Victoria in our day. The great park, not far distant, has a circuit of
eighteen miles; and west from the park is Windsor Forest, having a
circuit of fifty-six miles.

"It is many a year since I saw these places. I cannot expect to visit
them again; but this picture brings them vividly before me.

"And so, dear children, should you ever go to England, don't forget to
go to Cooper's Hill, and, for grandma's sake, to look round upon the
charming prospect which she loved so much when a child."

SATURDAY NIGHT.


Bring on the boots and shoes, Tommy; for this is Saturday night, and I
must make things clean for Sunday.

Here is my old jacket, to begin with. Whack, whack, whack! As I beat it
with my stick, how the dust flies!

The jacket looks a little the worse for wear; and that patch in the
elbow is more for show than use. But it is a good warm jacket still, and
mother says that next Christmas I shall have a new one.

Whack, whack, whack! I wish Christmas was not so far off. If somebody
would make me a present now of a handsome new jacket, without a patch in
it, I should take it as an especial kindness. I do hate to wear patched
clothes.

Stop there, Master Frank! You deserve to be beaten, instead of your
jacket. Look in the glass at your fat figure and rosy checks. Are you
not well fed and well taken care of? Is not good health better than fine
clothes? Are you the one to complain?

Ah, Frank! Just look at poor Tim Morris, as he goes by in his carriage.
See his fine rich clothes, and his new glossy hat. But see, too, how
pale and thin he looks. How gladly would he put on your patched jacket,
and give you his new one, if he could have your health!

[Illustration: Saturday Night]

Whack, whack, whack! I'm an ungrateful boy. I'll not complain again.
Christmas may be as long as it pleases in coming. I'll tell mother she
mustn't pinch herself to buy me a new jacket. I'll tell her this one
will serve me a long time yet; that I have got used to it, and like it.
It will look almost as good as new when I get the dust out of it. Whack,
whack, whack!

THE CUCKOO.


"Tell me what bird this is a picture of," said Arthur.

"That," said Uncle Oscar, "is the cuckoo, a bird which arrives in
England, generally, about the middle of April, and departs late in June,
or early in July."

"Why does it go so early?" asked Arthur.

"Well, I think it is because it likes a warm climate; and, as soon as
autumn draws near, it wants to go back to the woods of Northern Africa."

"Why is it called the cuckoo?"

"Because the male bird utters a call-note which sounds just like the
word _kuk-oo_. In almost every language, this sound has suggested the
name of the bird. In Greek, it is _kokkux_; in Latin, _coccyx_; in
French, _coucou_; in German, _kukuk_."

"What does the bird feed on?" asked Arthur.

"It feeds on soft insects, hairy caterpillars, and tender fruits."

"Where does it build its nest?"

"The cuckoo, I am sorry to say, is not a very honest bird. Instead of
taking the trouble to build a nest for herself, the female bird lays her
eggs in the nest of other birds, and to them commits the care of
hatching and rearing her offspring."

"I should not call that acting like a good parent," said Arthur. "Do the
other birds take care of these young ones that are not their own?"

"Oh, yes! they not only take care of them and feed them for weeks, but
sometimes they even let the greedy young cuckoos push their own children
out of the nest."

"That's a hard case," said Arthur. "Is there any American bird that acts
like the cuckoo?"

[Illustration: The Cuckoo]

"Oh, yes!" said Uncle Oscar. "There is a little bird called the
'cow-bunting,' about as large as a canary-bird: she, too, makes other
birds hatch her young and take care of them."

"I don't like such lazy behavior. Did you ever hear the note of the
cuckoo?" said Arthur.

"Oh, yes!" replied Uncle Oscar. "I have heard it in England; and there,
too, I have heard the skylark and the nightingale, neither of which
birds we have in America. But we have the mocking-bird, one of the most
wonderful of song-birds."

"I wonder if the cuckoo would not live in America," said Arthur. "I
should like to get one and try it. I would take good care of it."

"It would not thrive in this climate, Arthur."

WORK AND SING!


    You must work, and I must sing,
      That's the way the birdies do:
    See the workers on the wing;
      See the idle singers too.

    Yet not wholly idle these,
      They the toilers do not wrong;
    For the weary heart they ease
      With the rapture of their song.

    If our work of life to cheer
      We no music had, no flowers,
    Life would hardly seem so dear,
      Longer then would drag the hours.

    Like the birdies let us be;
      Let us not the singers chide;
    There's a use in all we see:
      Work and sing! the world is wide.

ONE YEAR OLD.


Hold her up, mamma, and let us all have a look at her. Is she not a dear
little thing?

She is not a bit afraid, but only puzzled at being stared at by so many
people. She does not know what to make of it.

She clutches at her mother's chin, as much as to say, "Tell me what this
means."

It means, baby, that you are one year old. This is your birthday, and
we have come to call on you.

[Illustration: Nurse, Baby, & Cat]

But here is Jane, the nurse. Has she come to take you away from us? We
are not ready to part with you.

You want to go with her? Well, that is too bad! You like her better
than you do me. I must see what she does that makes you so fond of her.

She takes you to the barn, and shows you the horse and the cow. Then she
lets you look out of the barn-window. There you spy the kitten.

The kitten sees you, and jumps up on the basket, and looks in your face.
You put out your little hand, and try to reach her.

Jane has the pig and the chickens to show you yet. But I cannot stay any
longer. I must leave you playing with the kitten.

MY DOG.


I have a dog, and his name is Don. He is nine years old. His master is
in Boston, and I call Don my dog, because I like to have him here. He is
a black-and-white dog, and measures six feet in length, and about two
feet in height.

When I go on errands, Don takes the basket or pail, and trots away to
the store; and sometimes I have to pull him, or he will go the wrong
way.

He is a lazy old fellow, and he likes to sleep almost all the time,
except when he is asked if he wants to go anywhere; and then he frisks
around, and seems as if he had never been asleep.

When he wants a drink, he goes around to the store-room door, and asks
for it by looking up in our faces; and I dare say he would say, if he
could speak, "Please give me a drink?"

I have a little brother, and he sits on my dog a good deal. And I have a
cousin of whom the dog is very fond and when she is at the table, he
will put his paw on her lap, and want her to take it.

My little baby-brother tumbles over the dog, and sits on him; and
sometimes when I am tired, I lie down and take a nap with my head on
Don's back. He likes to have me do it, and he always keeps watch while I
am asleep.

MAY.


    Pretty little violets, waking from your sleep,
    Fragrant little blossoms, just about to peep,
    Would you know the reason all the world is gay?
    Listen to the bobolinks, telling you 'tis May!

    Little ferns and grasses, all so green and bright,
    Purple clover nodding, daisies fresh and white,
    Would you know the reason all the world is gay?
    Listen to the bobolinks, telling you 'tis May!

    Darling little warblers, coming in the spring,
    Would you know the reason that you love to sing?
    Hear the merry children, shouting as they play,

[Illustration: Dot and The Lemons]

DOT AND THE LEMONS.


Dot's father is a funny man. One night, he brought home some lemons for
mamma,--twelve long, fat, yellow lemons, in a bag. Dot was sitting at
the piano with mamma when his father came in, and did not run, as usual,
to greet him with a kiss. So Dot's father opened the bag, and let the
lemons drop one by one, and roll all over the floor.

Then Dot looked around, and cried, "Lemons, lemons! Get down; Dot get
down!" And he ran and picked up the lemons one by one, and put them all
together in the great black arm-chair. As he picked them up, he counted
them: "One, two, three, five, six, seven, nine, ten!"

When Dot got tired of seeing them on the chair, he began to put them on
the floor again, one at a time, and all in one spot. While he was doing
this, his father stooped down, and when the little boy's back was
turned, took the lemons, slily from the spot where Dot was placing
them, and put them behind his own back,--some behind his right foot, and
some behind his left.

He took only a few of them at first, so that Dot should not miss them.
But, when Dot came to put the last lemon on the floor, he could not see
any thing of the others, and was very much surprised. Then mamma,
grandmamma, and grandpapa all burst out laughing. His father stepped
aside, and there Dot saw the lemons in two rows.

Then father said, "That was only a joke. Now, Dot, put them back again
on the chair--quick!" And Dot ran and began to take away the lemons from
the first row, and lay them on the black cushion of grandpapa's great
arm-chair, one by one. One--two--three--four--five: he had only one more
lemon to pick up from the first row; but when he came for it--my! there
were two.

Well, to tell the truth, Dot didn't notice this at first. He picked up
one of the two, and thought to himself, "Only one left, Dot." But, I
declare! there were _two_ left when he came back. "This is a long row,"
thought Dot. And every time he left _one_, he found _two_, till papa had
quite used up the second row, from which he had been filling up the
first.

At last Dot _did_ see the last lemon, and then again he didn't see it,
for when he looked for it, it wasn't _two_, as before, it wasn't there
at all!

"O papa! you have it behind you; and Dot will pull at your hand till you
give up the lemon; and then you can't play any more tricks with your
bright little boy."

But Dot will go up to bed with Alice, and in the middle of the night
mamma will hear him saying in his sleep, "Five, six, nine, 'lemon!" For
Dot always says '_lemon,_ when he means _eleven_.

    Daddy Dandelion
      Was a splendid fellow,
    With a coat of green,
      And a crest of yellow.
    He had lots of gold,
      He was very lazy;
    So he chose to scold
      Modest little Daisy.

    2.

    Ah! you silly flower,
      You're to me beholden,
    To your best of power,
      Aping me the golden.
    Just then some one passed,
      Who his stick was swinging,
    Chopped off Dandelion,
      Stopped his accents stinging.

    4.
    Daisy at the sight
      Dropped a tear for sorrow,
    Closed her leaves that night,
      Opened on the morrow.
    Gazing with delight
      People, all of them,
    Asked her where she found
      Such a sparkling gem.

N.B.--When any of these Magazines is desired in club with "The Nursery"
at the above rates, both Magazines must be subscribed for at the _same
time_; but they need not be to the same address. We furnish our own
Magazine, and agree to pay the subscription for the other. Beyond this
we take no responsibility. The publisher of each Magazine is responsible
for its prompt delivery; and complaints must be addressed accordingly.

NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS

The number of the Magazine with which your subscription _expires_ is
indicated by the number annexed to the address on the printed label.
When no such number appears, it will be understood that the subscription
ends with the current year. No notice of discontinuance need be given,
as the Magazine is never sent after the term of subscription expires.
Subscribers will oblige us by sending their renewals promptly. State
always that your payment is for a _renewal_, when such is the fact. In
changing the direction, the _old_ as well as the _new_ address should be
given. The sending of "The Nursery" will be regarded as a sufficient
receipt.

Any one not receiving it will please notify us immediately, giving date
of remittance.

ADDRESS, JOHN L. SHOREY, 36 Bromfield St., Boston, Mass.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
