  DEAR CHARLIE,--Rum mix this 'ere world is, yer never know _wot_'ll
          come next!
  Don't emagine I've sent yer a sermon, and treacle this out as my
          text;
  But really life's turn-ups are twisters. You lay out for larks,
          'ealth, and tin,
  But whenever you think it's "a moral," that crock, "Unexpected,"
          romps in.

  Who'd ha' thought of _me_ jacking up suddent, and giving the
          Sawbones a turn?
  Who'd ha' pictered _me_ "Taking the Waters"? Ah! CHARLIE, 'twos
          hodds on the Urn
  With Yours Truly, this time, I essure you. I fancied as
          Tot'nam-Court Road
  Would he trying its 'and on my tombstone afore the green corn wos
          full growed.

  _Bad_, CHARLIE? You bet! 'Twas screwmatics and liver, old Pill-box
          declared.
  Knocked me slap orf my perch, fair 'eels uppards. I tell you I
          felt a bit scared,
  And it left me a yaller-skinned skelinton, weak, and, wot's wus,
          stoney-broke.
  If it hadn't a bin for my nunky, your pal might have jest done a
          croak.

  Uncle NOBBS, a Cat's-butcher at Clapton, who's bin in luck's way,
          and struck ile,
  Is dead nuts on Yours Truly. Old josser, and grumpy, but _he_'s
          made his pile.
  Saw me settin' about in the garden, jest like a old saffron-gill'd
          ghost
  A-waiting for cock-crow to 'ook it, and hanxious to 'ear it--a'most.

  Sez he, "Wy, the boy is a bone-bag! Wot's that? Converlescent? Oh,
          fudge!
  He's a slipping his cable, and drifting out sea-wards, if _I_'m
          any judge.
  I was ditto some twenty year back, BOB, and 'Arrygate fust set
          _me_ up.
  Wot saved the old dog, brother ROBERT, may probably suit the young
          pup.

  "Carn't _afford_ it? O'course yer carn't, JENNY; but--thanks be to
          'orse-flesh--_I_ can--"
  Well, he tipped us a fifty-quid crisp 'un--and ROOSE sent me 'ere;
          he's _my_ Man!
  Three weeks' "treatment"! Well, threes into fifty means cutting a
          bit of a dash;
  Good grub, nobby togs, local doctor, baths, waters, and everythink
          flash.

  "'Appy 'ARRY!" sez you. But way-oh, CHARLIE! 'Arrygate isn't all
          jam.
  _Me_ jolly? Well, mate, if you arsk me, I carn't 'ardly say as I
          ham.
  To spread myself out with the toppers is proper, no doubt, bonny
          boy;
  But--I wish it wos Brighton, or Margit, or somewheres a chap could
          _enjoy_.

  Oh, them "Waters," old man!!! S'elp me never! yer don't kow wot
          nastyness _is_
  Till you've tried "Sulphur 'ot and strong," fasting. The Kissing
          Gin, taken a-fizz,
  Isn't _wus_ than ditch-water and sherbet; but Sulphur!!! It's
          eased my game leg;
  But I go with my heart in my mouth, and I feel like a blooming bad
          hegg.

  B-r-r-r-r! Beastliness isn't the word, CHARLIE. Language seems out
          of it, slap.
  When I took my fust twelve ounces 'ot, from a gal with a snowy
          white cap,
  And cheeks like a blush-rose for bloominess--well, I'm a gent,
          but, yah-hah!
  I jest did a guy at the double, without even nodding ta-ta!

  Where the Primrose Path leads to, my pippin, I'm cocksure can't
          'ave a _wus_ smell.
  Like bad eggs, salt, and tenpenny nails biled in bilge water.
          Eugh! Old Pump Well?
  Wy then let well alone, is my motter, or leastways, it would be,
          I'm sure,
  But for BLACK--local doctor, a stunner!--who's got me in 'and for
          a cure.

  I'm not nuts on baths took _too_ reglar; but 'Arrygate baths ain't
          'arf bad,
  When you git a bit used to 'em, CHARLIE. I squirmed, though fust
          off, dear old lad!
  They so soused, and so slapped, and so squirted me. Messing a
          feller about
  Don't come nicer for calling it _massage_. But there, it's O.K.
          I've no doubt.

  They squat you upon a low shelf, with a sort of a water-can "rose"
  At the nape of yer neck, while a feller in front squirts yer down
          with a 'ose.
  He slaps you as though you wos batter, he kneads you as if you wos
          dough,
  And gives yer wot for on the spine, till you git in a doose of a
          glow.

  Then you're popped in a big iron cage, where the 'ose plays upon
          you like fun;
  A lawn, or a house a-fire, CHARLIE, could not be more thoroughly
          done.
  Sez I, "I'm _insured_, dontcher know, mate; so don't _waste_ the
          water, d'ye 'ear?"
  But he didn't appear to arf twig. He seemed jest a bit thick in
          the clear.

  Then the bars of yer cage bustes out like a lot of scent fountings
          a-play--
  'Taint _oder colong_, though, by hodds; sulphur strong seems the
          local _bokay_.
  They call this the "Needle Bath," CHARLIE. It give _me_ the needle
          fust off;
  'Cos the spray would git into my eyes, and the squelch made me
          sputter and cough.

  Then they wrop you well up in 'ot towels, and leave yer five
          minutes to bake,
  And that's the "_Aix Douche_," as they call it. _I_ call it the
          funniest fake
  In the way of a bath I 'ave met with; but, bless yer, it passes
          the time,
  And _I_ shan't want a tub for a fortnit when back in Old
          Babbylon's grime.

  Dull 'ole, this 'ere 'Arrygate, CHARLIE! The only fair fun _I_ can
          find
  Is watching the poor sulphur-swiggers, a-gargling and going it
          blind.
  Oh, the sniffs and sour faces, old fellow, the shudders and
          shivers, and sighs;
  The white lips a-working like rabbits', the sheepish blue-funk in
          their eyes!

  Old Pump Room's a hoctygon building, rum blend like of chapel and
          bar,
  With a big stained-glass winder one side, hallygorical subject! So
          far
  As I've yet made it out, it's a hangel a-stirring up somethink
          like suds.
  "A-troubling the waters," I 'eard from a party in clerical duds.

  You arsk, like you do at a bar, for the speeches of lotion you want.
  _Some_ say; you git used to the flaviour, and _like it_! Bet long
          hodds _I_ shan't.
  I've sampled the lot, my dear CHARLIE, Strong Sulphur and Mild,
          Cold _and_ 'Ot;
  And all I can say is, the jossers who say it ain't beastly talk rot.

  You jest fox their faces! They enters, looks round, gives a shy
          sort of sniff,
  Seem to contemplate doing a guy, brace their legs, keep their
          hupper lips stiff;
  Take their tickets, walk up to the counter, assumin' a sham sort
          of bounce,
  And ask, shame-faced like, for their gargle, 'as p'r'aps is a 'ot
          sixteen hounce.

  When they git it, a-fume in a tumbler, a-smelling like hegg-chests
          gone wrong,
  They squirm, ask the snowy-capped gurl, "Is _this_ right?"--"Yes,
          Sir. Sixteen ounce, strong!"
  Sez the minx with a cold kind o' smile. "Ah--h--h! _per_cisely!"
          they smirks, and walks round,
  With this "Yorkshire Stinko" in their 'ands--and their 'earts in
          their mouths I'll be bound.

  Then--Gulp! Oh Gewillikins, CHARLIE! it gives yer the ditherums,
          it do.
  Bad enough if you 'ave to wolf _one_, but it fair gives yer beans
          when 'tis _two_.
  The wictims waltz round, looking white, wishing someone would just
          spill _their_ wet,
  And--there's 'ardly a glass "returned empty" but wot shows its
          'eel-taps, you bet!

  This is "Taking the Waters" at 'Arrygate! Well, I shall soon take
          my 'ook.
  Speshal Scotch, at my favourite pub, from that sparkling young
          dona, NELL COOK,
  Will do me a treat arter this, mate, and come most pertikler A 1.
  'Ow I long to be back in "The Village," dear boy, with its bustle
          and fun!

  Still, the air 'ere's as fresh as they make it, and gives yer a
          doose of a peck,
  And DUNSING, the Boss at "The Crown," does yer proper. I came 'ere
          a wreck;
  But sulphur, sound sleep, and cool breezes, prime prog, and good
          company tells;
  So 'ere's bully for 'Arrygate, CHARLIE, in spite of rum baths and
          bad smells.

  That Fifty is nearly played out, and my slap at the Ebor went
          wrong--
  I'd a Yorkshire tyke's tip, too, old man; but I'm stoney, though
          still "going strong"
  (As _Lord Arthur_ remarks in the play), so no more at "The Crown"
          I must tarry,
  But if 'Arrygate wants a good word--as to 'ealth--it shall 'ave it
          from

'ARRY.

THE FIGHTING "FOUDROYANT"

BEING TUGGED TO ITS LAST BERTH--IN A SHIPBREAKER'S YARD.

(_A THEME FROM TURNER TREATED IN MODERN BRITISH STYLE, WITH APOLOGIES
TO THE PATRIOTIC PAINTER OF "THE FIGHTING 'TEMERAIRE.'"_)

  "Mayhap you have heard, that as dear as their lives,
  All true-hearted Tars love their ships and their wives."
  So DIBDIN declared, and he spoke for the Tar;
  He knew Jack so well, both in peace and in war!
  But hang it! times change, and 'tis sad to relate,
  The old Dibdinish morals seem quite out of date;
  Stick close to your ship, lads, like pitch till you die?--
  That sounds nonsense to-day, and I'll tell ye for why.

  The good old _Foudroyant_--how memory dwells on
  Those brave fighting names!--was once flag-ship to NELSON.
  But NELSON, you know, died a good while ago,
  And his flag-ship has gone a bit shaky, and so
  JOHN BULL, who's now full of low shopkeeping cares,
  And thinks more of the Stocks than of naval affairs,
  Regards not "Old Memories," that "eat off their head."
  Turn old cracks out to grass? No, let's sell 'em instead!

  A ship's like the high-mettled racer once sung
  By that same dashing DIBDIN of patriot tongue,
  Grown aged, used up, is he honoured? No, zounds!
  "The high-mettled racer is sold to the hounds!"
  And so with a barky of glorious name,
  (It is business, of course--_and a Thundering Shame!_)
  Worn out, she is nought but spars, timbers and logs,
  And so, like the horse, should be sold--to the dogs!

  As for the _Foudroyant_, the vessel was trim
  When it fought with the French, for JOHN BULL, under _Him_,
  The Star of the Nile. Yes, it carried _his_ flag,
  When it captured the Frenchman. There's no need to brag,
  Or to say swagger things of a generous foe.
  Besides, things have doosedly altered, you know.
  _We_'re no more like NELSON than I to a Merman;
  _We_ can sell his flag-ship for firewood, to the German!

  Sounds nice, does it not? If that great one-armed Shade
  Could look down on the bargain he'd--swear, I'm afraid
  (If his death-purged bold spirit held yet ought of earth).
  And I fancy 'twill move the gay Frenchman to mirth
  To hear this last story of shop-keeping JOHN--
  Or his huckster officials. The Frenchman, the Don,
  The Dutchman, all foes we have licked,--may wax bold
  When they hear that the brave old _Foudroyant_ is--Sold!!!

  Great TURNER has pictured the old _Temeraire_
  Tugged to _her_ last berth. Why the sun and the air
  In that soul-stirring canvas, seem fired with the glory
  Of such a brave ship, with so splendid a story!
  Well, look on that picture, my lads, and on _this_!
  And--no, do not crack out a curse like a hiss,
  But with stout CONAN DOYLE--_he_ has passion and grip!--
  Demand that they give us back NELSON's old Ship!

  British hands from protecting her who shall debar?
  Ne'er ingratitude lurked in the heart of a Tar.
  "(Sings DIBDIN) That Ship from the breakers to save"
  Is the plainest of duties e'er put on the brave.
  While a rag, or a timber, or spar, she can boast,
  A place of prime honour on Albion's coast
  Should be hers and the _Victory's!_ Let us not say,
  Like the fish-hucksters, "_Memories_ are cheap, Sir, to-day!"

       *       *       *       *       *

ECCLESIASTICAL TASTE.--A condiment not much in favour with High
Churchmen just now, must be "Worcester Sauce." It is warranted to
neutralise the very highest flavour.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Of "garnered leaves"
  And "garnered sheaves"
    Sing sentimental donkeys.

  Their simple song
    Will be of Garnered Monkeys!

"A railway from Joppa to Jerusalem" sounds like a Scriptural Line. In
future, "going to Jericho" will not imply social banishment, as the
party sent thither will be able to take a return-ticket.

THE LAY OF THE LAST KNIGHT.

  My name and style are ELLIS ASHMEAD BART--
  Ah! happy augury. Would I could
  Leave it so. But 'twill not do.
  Like soap of Monkey brand,
  It will not wash clothes,
  Or, in truth, ought else.
  'Tis but an accident of rhythm
  Born of the imperative mood that makes one
  Start a poem of this kind on ten feet,
  Howe'er it may thereafter crawl or soar.
  What I really was about to remark was that
  My name and style are ELLIS ASHMEAD BART-
  LETT, Knight; late Civil Lord of Admiralty
  You know me. I come from Sheffield; at least
  I did on my return thence
  Upon re-election.

II.

  A sad world this, my masters, as someone--
  Was it my friend SHAKSPEARE?--
  Says. The sadness arises upon reflection, not
  That I'm a Knight, but that I am, so to speak,
  A Knight of only two letters.
  As thus--Kt. 'Tis but a glimmer of a night,
  If I, though sore at heart, may dally with
  The English tongue
  And make a pensive pun.

III.

  Of course I expected different things from
  The MARKISS.
  What's the use, what's the purpose,
  Of what avail, wherefore,
  That a man should descend from the
  Spacious times of ELIZABETH with nothing
  In his hand other than a simple Knighthood?
  Anyone could do that.
  It might be done to anyone.
  He, him, all, any, both, certain, few,
  Many, much, none, one, other, another.
  One another, several, some, such and whole.
  Why, he made a Knight
  At the same time,
  In the same manner,
  Of
      MAPLE
          BLUNDELL!

IV.

  Look here, MARKISS, you know,
  This won't do.
  It may pass in a crowd, but not with
  ELLIS ASHMEAD BART--
  (There it is again. Evidently doesn't matter
  About the feet)
  LETT.

V.

  And yet MARKISS, mine,
  I shall not despair.
  You are somewhat out of it
  At the present moment.
  And I am not sure--
  Not gorged with certainty--
  That Mr. G. would be
  Inclined to make amends.
  He is old; he is aged.
  Prejudice lurks amid
  His scant white locks,
  And forbids the stretch-
  Ing forth of generous hand in whose
  Recesses coyly glint
  The Bart. or K.C.B.

VI.

  But you are not everyone;
  Nor is he. Nor do both together
  In the aggregate
  Compose the great globe
  And all that therein is.
  I'll wait awhile, possessing my soul in
  Patience.
  Everything comes to the man who waits.
  (Sometimes, 'tis true, 'tis the bobby
  Who asks what he's loafing there for,
  And bids him
  Move on.
  That is a chance the brave resolute soul
  Faces.) The pity of it is
  That you, MARKISS, having so much to give,
  So little gave
        To
            Me.

VII.

  Oh, MARKISS! MARKISS!
  Had I but served my GLADSTONE
  As I have served thee,
  He would not have forsak--
  But that's another story.

THE NEW HOPERA OF 'ADDON 'ALL.--The title finally decided upon for the
SULLIVAN-GRUNDY Opera is _Haddon Hall_. Lovely for 'ARRY! "'Ave you
seen _'Addon 'All_?" Then the 'ARRY who 'as only 'eard a portion of
it, will say, "I _'addn_'t 'eard _'all._" As a Cockney title, it's
perfect. Successful or not, Author and Composer will congratulate
themselves that, to deserve, if not command success, they _'ad don
all_ they knew. If successful, they'll replace the aspirates, and it
will be some time before they recover the exact date when they Had-don
Hauling in the coin. _Prosit!_

MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.--Says the _Pall Mall Gazette_:--"For knocking
over a man selling watercress, with fatal results, a Hammersmith
cabman has been committed for trial for manslaughter." If this is
true, the HOME SECRETARY should immediately interpose. The action
of knocking a man over is hasty, and may be indefensible. But if
the Hammersmith Cabman had just grounds for belief that the man
was "selling watercresses with fatal results," he should rather be
commended than committed for trial.

like any other sort of "bus" as I see before my blessed eyes every

NO. XV.--TO SWAGGER.

[Illustration]

Not long ago I reminded you of CHEPSTOWE, the incomparable poet who
was at one time supposed to have revolutionised the art of verse.
Now he is forgotten, the rushlight which he never attempted to
hide under the semblance of a bushel, has long since nickered its
last, his boasts, his swelling literary port, his quarrels, his
affectations--over all of them the dark waves of oblivion have passed
and blotted them from the sand on which he had traced them. But in his
day, as you remember, while yet he held his head high and strutted
in his panoply, he was a man of no small consequence. Quite an army
of satellites moved with him, and did his bidding. To one of them
he would say, "Praise me this author," and straightway the fire of
eulogy would begin. To another he would declare--and this was his more
frequent course--"So-and-so has dared to hint a fault in one of us;
he has hesitated an offensive dislike. Let him be scarified," and
forthwith the painted and feathered young braves drew forth their axes
and scalping-knives, and the work of slaughter went merrily forward.
Youth, modesty, honest effort, genuine merit, a manifest desire to
range apart from the loud storms of literary controversy, these were
no protection to the selected victim. And of course the operations of
the Chepstowe-ites, like the "plucking" imagined by _Major Pendennis_,
were done in public. For they had their organ. Week by week in _The
Metropolitan Messenger_ they disburdened themselves, each one of his
little load of spite and insolence and vanity, and with much loud
shouting and blare of adulatory trumpets called the attention of the
public to their heap of purchasable rubbish. There lived at this time
a great writer, whose name and fame are still revered by all who love
strong, nervous English, vivid description, and consummate literary
art. He stood too high for attack. Only in one way could the herd
of passionate prigs who waited on CHEPSTOWE do him an injury. They
could attempt, and did, to imitate his style in their own weekly
scribblings. _Corruptio optimi pessima_. There is no other phrase
that describes so well the result of these imitative efforts. All the
little tricks of the great man's humour were reproduced and defaced,
the clear stream of his sentences was diverted into muddy channels,
the airy creatures of his imagination were weighted with lead and made
to perform hideous antics. Never had there been so riotous a jargon
of distorted affectation and ponderous balderdash. Smartness--of a
sort--these gentlemen, no doubt, possessed. It is easy to be accounted
smart in a certain circle, if only you succeed in being insolent.
Merit of this order the band could boast of plenteously.

One peculiarity, too, must be noted in _The Metropolitan Messenger_.
It had a magnetic attraction for all the sour and sorry failures whose
reputation and income, however greatly in excess of their deserts,
had not equalled their expectation. The Cave of Adullam could not have
been more abundantly stocked with discontent. It is the custom of the
_rates_ everywhere to attempt to prevent, or, if that be impossible,
to decry success in others, in order to exalt themselves. The
"Metropolitans" followed the example of many unillustrious
predecessors, though it must, in justice, be added, that they would
have been shocked to hear anyone impute to them a want of originality
in their curious methods. In the counsels of these literary bravos,
WILLIAM GRUBLET held a high place. At the University, where he had
pursued a dull and dingy career of modified respectability, not much
was thought or spoken of GRUBLET. If he was asked what profession he
proposed to adopt, he would wink knowingly, and reply, "Journalism."
It sounded well--it gave an impression of influence, and future power,
and, moreover, it committed him to nothing. It is just as easy to say
"Journalism," in answer to the stock question, as it is to deliver
yourself over, by anticipation, to the Bar, the Church, or the Stock
Exchange. Hundreds of young men at both our ancient Universities
look upon Journalism as the easiest and most attractive of all the
professions. In the first place there are no Examinations to bar
the way, and your ordinary Undergraduate loathes an Examination as
a rat may be supposed to loathe a terrier. What can be easier--in
imagination--than to dash off a leading article, a biting society
sketch, a scathing review, to overturn ancient idols, to inaugurate
movements, to plan out policies? All this GRUBLET was confident
of being able to do, and he determined, on the strength of a few
successful College Essays, and a reputation for smartness, acquired
at the expense of his dwindling circle of intimates, to do it. He
took his degree, and plunged into London. There, for a time, he was
lost to public sight. But I know that he went through the usual
contest. Rejected manuscripts poured back into his room. Polite,
but unaccommodating Editors, found that they had no use for vapid
imitations of ADDISON, or feeble parodies of CHARLES LAMB. Literary
appreciations, that were to have sent the ball of fame spinning up the
hill of criticism, grew frowsy and dog's-eared with many postages to
and fro.

In this protracted struggle with fate and his own incompetence, the
nature of GRUBLET, never a very amiable one, became fatally soured,
and when he finally managed to secure a humble post on a newspaper, he
was a disappointed man with rage in his heart against his successful
rivals and against the Editors who, as he thought, had maliciously
chilled his glowing aspirations. His vanity, however,--and he was
always a very vain man--had suffered no diminution, and with the
first balmy breezes of success his arrogance grew unbounded. Shortly
afterwards, he chanced to come in the way of CHEPSTOWE; he impressed
the poet favourably, and in the result he was selected for a place
on the staff of _The Metropolitan Messenger_, then striving by every
known method to battle its way into a circulation.

It was at this stage in his career that I met GRUBLET. He was pointed
out to me as a young man of promise who had a trenchant style, and had
lately written an article on "Provincialism in Literature," which had
caused some stir by its bitter and uncompromising attacks upon certain
well-known authors and journalists. I looked at the man with some
interest. I saw a pale-faced, sandy-haired little creature with a
shuffling, weak-kneed gait, who looked as if a touch from a moderately
vigorous arm would have swept him altogether out of existence.
His manner was affected and unpleasant, his conversation the most
disagreeable I ever listened to. He was coarse, not with an ordinary
coarseness, but with a kind of stale, fly-blown coarseness as of
the viands in the window of a cheap restaurant. He assumed a great
reverence for RABELAIS and ARISTOPHANES; he told shady stories,
void of point and humour, which you were to suppose were modelled
on the style of these two masters. And all the time he gave you to
understand, with a blatant self-sufficiency, that he himself was one
of the greatest and most formidable beings in existence. This was
GRUBLET as I first knew him, and so he continued to the end.

The one thing this puny creature could never forgive was that any
of his friends should pass him in the race. There was one whom
GRUBLET--the older of the two--had at one time honoured with his
patronage and approval. No sooner, however, had the younger gained a
literary success, than the sour GRUBLET turned upon him, and rent him.
"This fellow," said GRUBLET, "will get too uppish--I must show up his
trash"; and accordingly he fulminated against his friend in the organ
that he had by that time come to consider as his own. This baseless
sense of proprietorship, in fact, it was that wrecked GRUBLET. In an
evil moment for himself he tried to ride rough-shod over CHEPSTOWE,
and that temporary genius dismissed him with a promptitude that should
stand to his credit against many shortcomings. GRUBLET, I believe,
still exists. Occasionally, in obscure prints, I seem to detect traces
of his style. But no one now pays any attention to him. His claws
are clipped, his teeth have been filed down. He shouts and struts,
unregarded. For we live, of course, in milder and more reasonable
days, and the GRUBLETS can no longer find a popular market for their
wares.

Only one question remains. How in the world can even you, oh respected
SWAGGER, have derived any pleasure from witnessing the performances
that GRUBLET went through, after you had persuaded him that he was
a man of some importance? I do not expect an answer, and remain as
before,

    ["We are presented just now with two spectacles, which may
    help us to take modest and diffident views of the progress of
    the species.... At home there is an utterly unreasonable and
    unaccountable financial panic among the depositors in the
    Birkbeck Bank, while in America the free and enlightened
    democracy of a portion of New York State has suddenly relapsed
    into primitive barbarism under the influence of fear of
    cholera."--_The Times_.]

  What is he doing, our new god Pan,
    Far from the reeds and the river?
  Spreading mischief and scattering ban,
  Screening 'neath "knickers" his shanks of a goat,
  And setting the wildest rumours afloat,
    To set the fool-mob a-shiver.

  He frightened the shepherds, the old god Pan,[1]
    Him of the reeds by the river;
  Afeared of his faun-face, Arcadians ran;
  Unsoothed by the pipes he so deftly could play,
  The shepherds and travellers scurried away
    From his face by forest or river.

  And back to us, sure, comes the great god Pan,
    With his pipes from the reeds by the river;
  Starting a scare, as the goat-god can,
  Making a Man a mere wind-swayed reed,
  And moving the mob like a leaf indeed
    By a chill wind set a-quiver.

  He finds it sport, does our new god Pan
    (As did he of the reeds by the river),
  To take all the pith from the heart of a man,
  To make him a sheep--though a tiger in spring,--
  A cruel, remorseless, poor, cowardly thing,
    With the whitest of cheeks--and liver!

  "Who said I was dead?" laughs the new god Pan
    (Laughs till his faun-cheeks quiver),
  "I'm still at my work, on a new-fangled plan.
  Scare is my business; I think I succeed,
  When the Mob at my minstrelsy shakes like a reed,
    And I mock, as the pale fools shiver."

  Shrill, shrill, shrill, O Pan!
    Your Panic-pipes, far from the river!
  Deafening shrill, O Poster-Pan!
  Turning a man to a timorous brute
  With irrational fear. From your frantic flute
    Good sense our souls deliver!

  Men rush like the Gadaree swine, O Pan!
    With contagious fear a-shiver,
  They flock like _Panurge's_ poor sheep, O Pan!
  What, what shall the merest of manhood quicken
  In geese gregarious, panic-stricken
    Like frighted fish in the river.

  You sneer at the shame of them, Poster-Pan,
    Poltroons of the pigeon-liver.
  Your placards gibbet them, Poster-Pan,
  Who crowd like curs in the cowardly crush,
  Who flock like sheep in the brainless rush
    With fear or greed a-shiver.

  You are half a beast, O new god Pan!
    To laugh (as you laughed by the river)
  Making a brute-beast out of a man:
  The true gods sigh for the cost and pain
  Of Civilisation, which seems but vain
    When the prey of your Panic shiver!

startle travellers by his sudden and terror-striking appearances.
Hence sudden fright, without any visible cause, was ascribed to Pan,
and called a Panic fear.]

  My pen is, as they say, "all of a tremble"--
  The pen that once enthralled the myriad crowd,
  The pen that critics one and all allowed
  Wrote pleasantly and well, was often funny,
  The pen that brought renown, and--better--money.
  My pen is stilled. That happy time is o'er,
  Like that old English King, I smile no more.
  Now that Sir (Secretary) GEORGE has spoken,
  My fortunes (and alas! my heart) are broken;
  For though I may not lack all understanding,
  My "genius" cannot claim to be "commanding."

LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.

_Mount Street, Grosvenor Square_.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I got so wet on the St. Leger day, that I've been in
bed ever since--not because I had to wait till my things were dry--but
because I caught a cold! _What_ a day it was!--I am told that in
addition to the St. Leger, Doncaster is chiefly celebrated for _Butter
Scotch_--if so, I presume they don't make it out-of-doors, or it
would have stood a good chance of being melted--(not in the mouth)--on
Wednesday fortnight! But the excitement of the race fully made
up for the liquid weather, and we all--(except the backers of
_Orme_)--enjoyed ourselves. I was told that the Duke of WESTMINSTER
had "left the Leger at Goodwood," which is simply absurd, as I not
only saw it run for at Doncaster myself, but it is ridiculous to
insinuate that the Duke went there, put the Leger in his pocket--(as
if a Nobleman ever kept books)--walked off quietly to Goodwood and
left it there deliberately!

I conclude it can only be an expression coined to discount--(another
ledger term)--the victory of _La Fleche_,--to which not half enough
attention has been drawn, solely (in my opinion) because _La Fleche_
is of the gentler sex, and men don't like the "horse of the year" to
be a mare.

I still maintain she was unlucky to lose the Derby, as she won
the Oaks two days later in two seconds quicker time:--(which is an
anachronism--as if you win _once_ out of _twice_--how can it be two
_seconds_?)

There was good sport at Yarmouth last week, though owing to the rain
the course must have been on the soft (roe) side,--by the way you can
get them now in bottles, and very good they are. I am glad to see that
staunch supporter of the turf, Lord ELTHAM, winning races again--as
his horses have been much out of form lately, at least so I am told,
but I was not aware that horses were in a "form" at all, unless being
"schooled" over hurdles.

I shall have a word or two to say on the Cesarewitch shortly--having
had some private information calculated to break a ROTHSCHILD if
followed--but for the moment will content myself with scanning the
programme of the Leicester and Manchester Meetings.

There are two races which seem perhaps worth picking up--one at each
place; and, while giving my selection for the Leicestershire race in
the usual verse, I will just mention that I should have given Lord
DUNRAVEN's _Inverness_ for the Manchester race, but that I see his
Lordship has sent it to America--rather foolish, now that winter is
coming on; but perhaps he has another, and may be doing a kindness to
some poor American Cousin! _St. Angelo_ might win this race without an
Inverness, though I presume he will appear in _some_ sort of clothing.

Yours devotedly, LADY GAY.

VERY ENTERTAINING.

Dear MR. PUNCH,--So much is done by the organisers of the Primrose
League in the shape of amusements for the people, that it seems
strange "the other side" should not follow suit. Without having
decided political opinions, I like both the Government and Her
Majesty's Opposition to be on equal terms. Hence my suggestion. I see
that, a few days ago, Mr. GLADSTONE, in speaking to an audience at
Barmouth, made the following remarks. He said--He belonged to almost
every part of the country. A Scotchman by blood, born in Lancashire,
and resident in London, he had become closely attached to Wales by
marriage, and had now become too old to get rid of that inclination.
Surely these admissions conjure up the possibility of a really
excellent entertainment. To show you what I mean, I jot down,
in dramatic form, my notion of the manner in which the PREMIER's
excellent idea should be worked out:--

    SCENE--_A large hall, with a platform. On the platform,
    Committee and Chairman. In front of the Chairman, large table,
    with cloth reaching to the floor. Water-bottle, and tumbler,
    and lamp._

_Chairman._ Ladies and Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in
announcing that the Right Hon. W.E. GLADSTONE (_cheers_), will give
his entertainment entitled "The Man of Many Characters" almost
immediately. The PREMIER's train is a little late, but--ah, here
come his fore-runners. (_Enter two Servants in livery with a large
basket-box, which they place under the table and then retire._) And
now we may expect the PREMIER immediately.

    [_Enter Mr. GLADSTONE in evening dress hurriedly. He is
    received with thunders of applause._

_Mr. Gladstone._ Ladies and Gentlemen! (_Great cheering._) I regret
I have kept you waiting for some quarter of an hour. My excuse must
be that I caused the train to be pulled up, because I noticed at a
wayside station a crowd of villagers who, apparently, were desirous
to hear me speak. You must forgive me, for it was for the good of
the nation. (_Cheers._) And now without preface, I will appear as my
friend Farmer HODGE. (_Loud applause, during which the PREMIER dives
under the table and re-appears in character. Continued applause._) I
be mighty glad to see ye. And now, I'll tell ye what I thinks about
the Eight Hours' Bill. (_Airs his opinions in "Zomerzetshire" for
some twenty minutes. At the conclusion of his performance re-appears
in evening dress-coat. Applause._) Thank you very much. But although
Farmer HODGE is a very good fellow, I think SANDIE MACBAWBEE is even
better. With your permission, I will appear as SANDIE MACBAWBEE.
(_Disappears under table, and re-appears in Highland Costume.
Cheers._) Dinna fash yourselves! Ma gracious! It's ma opinion that
you'll just hear a wee bit about Home Rule for Bonnie Scotland. Well,
ye ken--(_Airs his opinions upon his chosen subject in broad Scotch.
After a quarter of an hour he re-appears, and receives the usual
applause._) Thank you from the bottom of my heart. And now as I have
shown you Scotland and England, I think you would be pleased with
a glimpse of London. (_Cheers._) You all like London, do you not?
(_Applause._) With your kind permission, I will re-appear as a noted
character in the great tragic comedy of the world's Metropolis.
(_Dives down and comes up as a Costermonger. Prolonged applause._)
What cheer! (_Laughter._) Well, you blokes what are you grinning at?
I am a chickaleary cove, that's what I am. But I know what would knock
you! You would like to 'ear about 'Ome Rule. Eh? What cheer! 'Ere
goes. (_Reveals his Home-Rule scheme with a Cockney twang and dialect.
Then disappears and re-appears in his customary evening dress._) Thank
you most earnestly. (_Loud cheers._) And now I am afraid I must bid
you good-bye. But before leaving, I must confess to you that I have
never had the honour of appearing before a juster, more intelligent,
and more appreciative audience. [_Bows and exit._

_Voices._ Encore! Encore! Encore!

_Mr. Gladstone_ (_returning_). I am deeply touched by this sign
of public confidence. I would willingly continue my character
illustrations indefinitely, but, unfortunately, I am required in
another part of the country to repeat the same performances. I have
only just time to catch my special train. Thank you again and again.

    [_Exit hurriedly, after kissing his hand. The Footmen
    reappear, and take away the large box. Applause, and Curtain._

There, my dear _Mr. Punch_, is the rough idea. I feel sure it could be
carried through with the greatest possible advantage.

Believe me, yours most truly, AN EARNEST PATRIOT.

THE QUEEN OF MAN-O'ER-BOARD.

_A NOVEL IN LITTLE FROM A DRAMA IN FULL._

CHAPTER I.--_LADY VIOLET MALVERN AT HOME._

It was a gorgeous entertainment, consisting chiefly of recitations
and the "_Intermezzo_." Lady VIOLET MALVERN was _the_ life and soul
of the party. But there were lesser lights in a Baron FINOT, an old
diplomatist, and a Major GARRETT, an officer in retreat. Then came
ARMAND SEVARRO. He was an adventurer, and a friend of Baron FINOT, and
had a solitary anecdote.

"I am going to be married to a young lady of the name of DOROTHY
BLAIR, but cannot reveal the secret, because her mother is not well
enough to hear the news."

Then ARMAND met Lady VIOLET.

"I dreamed years ago of going to the City of Manoa to find its queen.
I have found her this evening."

"And she is--?" queried Lady VIOLET.

"You!" hissed the Brazilian (he was a Brazilian), and departed.

"What folly!" murmured Lady VIOLET, in the moonlight.

And many agreed with her.

CHAPTER II.--_THE GARDEN OF DOROTHY BLAIR._

DOROTHY was on the Thames. There came to her ARMAND.

"Will you never publish our contemplated marriage?" she asked.

"How can I, child?" he replied. "How can I reveal the secret when your
mother is not well enough to hear the news?"

It was his solitary anecdote.

She sighed, and then came a steam-launch. It contained Lady VIOLET,
the other characters, lunch, and (played off) the "_Intermezzo_."

Then ARMAND preferred to flirt with Lady VIOLET to DOROTHY.

"What nonsense!" thought DOROTHY.

And her thoughts found an echo in the breasts of the audience.

CHAPTER III.--_SMOKE IN THE SMOKING-ROOM._

And the Right Hon. RICHARD MALVERN, having had supper, was jealous of
his wife. He told Lady VIOLET that he considered ARMAND _de trop_. But
he did it so amiably that it touched Lady VIOLET deeply.

"I will send ARMAND away," she replied. Then she told the Brazilian
that it was his duty to stay away until his engagement was announced.

"But how can it be announced?" he replied, repeating his solitary
anecdote. "I am engaged to a young lady, but I cannot reveal the
secret, because her mother is not well enough to hear the news."

Then Lady VIOLET bade him, haughtily, adieu! He departed, but
returned, accompanied by the "_Intermezzo_." Then--probably at the
suggestion of the music--she hugged him. Then he left her.

"This is very wearisome," murmured Lady VIOLET.

And the audience agreed with her.

CHAPTER IV.--_A WEIR ON THE THAMES._

It being moonlight, Lady VIOLET walked on a terrace, and admired
a dangerous weir. There was a shriek, and the Brazilian rushed in
accompanied by the "_Intermezzo_."

"Fly with me to any part of the Desert that pleases you most."

"I would be most delighted," replied Lady VIOLET; "I would sacrifice
myself to any extent, but I would not annoy my husband."

"Then let me kiss you with the aid of MASCAGNI," and he pressed his
lips to her brow, to the accompaniment of the "_Intermezzo_."

"I have been to Manoa, and kissed its Queen," said the Brazilian, as
he jumped into the weir, wearily. "It would have been better had I
died before."

"Yes," thought Lady VIOLET, as she leisurely fainted, "it would indeed
have been better had he died in the First Act than in the last.
Then the piece would have been shorter, more satisfactory, and less
expensive to produce. Nay, more--a solitary Act might have been one
too many!" And yet again the audience, "all o'er-bored," entirely
agreed with her!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
