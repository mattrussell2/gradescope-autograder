MOTHER'S PRAYER


  For this new day, our Father, we give thee thanks.
  Thou hast blessed us with rest for our bodies,
  The glories of a new day are upon us, a gift from above.
  Let the light from heaven penetrate our souls,
  and may this be the best of our lives, we pray.
  Remember those less fortunate, dear Father,
  May some messenger of thine bring joy to their hearts today.
  Forbid we should shirk any duty coming our way,
  for we are thy servants and desire to do thy will.
  Our Dear Father thou hast blessed us with many dear ones.
  I pray thy blessing upon each one, especially our soldier boys
  That they may heed thy voice and follow thee
  as their great and true leader. Forbid, dear Lord, that any one
  of them be lost from the way in his search for the light.
  Go before them and let light from above
  make their pathway bright. Come into their hearts
  and give them the peace that no man can give, neither can
  take it away. I humbly ask these favors in Jesus name.

--KAY MCKEE




LET THERE BE PEACE


  Let there be peace, let clouds and storm roll past,
  And budding groves burst forth in little leaves.
  When April showers flush the brooks and eaves;
  May gardens grow and wheat go flowing fast.
  Let there be peace on earth, that men may cast
  Their hatreds far away and gather sheaves
  Of golden days in patterns justice weaves;
  That sunset hours may glow with love at last,
  The atmosphere be filled with faith and light,
  No war, nor bombs, no words of discontent.
  Let there be peace on every hill and plain,
  That men may live and toil with hearts alight,
  That each may aid his brother in content.
  Let grasses grow and flowers bloom again.




WHAT IS THIS WISDOM


  Remaining staunchly there in shriveled earth,
  The canna stood serene, refreshed by dew
  That silently, each cooling night anew
  Spread living gems to sparkle in their mirth.
  Beneath, the bulb lay proving well its birth--
  A shower passed, the funnel leaves caught true--
  The plant awoke with life and beauty too.
  And not a drop was wasted of the worth!

  The bud refrained from coming into bloom,
  As though it waited for the lusty rain,
  With low leaves dried and drooping to the ground.
  What is this wisdom in all nature's room
  That fights to live and grow, and not in vain,
  But God, whose strength in all things may be found.




SOLDIER TRAINS


  Hear the rumbling of the trains,
    Soldier trains.
  Ever droning, jarring, roaring on the rails
  Through the amber lights of dawn.
  Hear them rolling right along
  Now acoming and now gone,
    Iron wheel follows wheel,
  Round the bend of the river going strong.

  They are taking our brave soldier boys
  To the barracks. Hear the thumping of the drums
  How they beat and beat and beat,
  In the morning and at night,
  Hear the tramping, marching feet,
    All in line stepping fine
  Hear the praying from the firesides down the street.

  Hear the roaring of the trains,
    Speeding trains
  With the rumbling. Shouting home-boys off to war!
  Now they travel to far shores.
  See them waving their good-byes,
  There's the girl that Joe adores
    Waving hand, smiling band!
  Hear the laughter from the windows and the doors.




DEAR POSSESSIONS


  A loaf of bread with a glass of milk
  With a roof that shelters and a restful bed,
  A place to wear the faded silk
  And a pillow for the aching head;

  A kettle that sings while the night wind sighs,
  And a cup of tea to drink;
  A hearth to sweep and a babe that cries,
  With a pile of dishes in the sink.

  A home to keep and a man to love,
  With a heart that is true and fine.
  These precious things sent from heaven above,
  Will be prized for yours and for mine.




THE UNBIDDEN TEARS


  Glad tears that rush like rivers down the cheek
  Like gilding gold of morning's amber light.
  O happy hearts, by hearths when wills are meek!
  We welcome sun that chased away the night.
  The weeping eyes will not acknowledge hate.
  When lovers meet forgiven after pain,
  Tears cleanse the heart and mind of fire and mote,
  And freshen countenance and bleach the stain.
  O rain of peace, that washes doubt away,
  And casts a burden from the heart and home.
  Sad hearts in joy united on this day;
  Now buds will bloom again in garden loam.
  Glad tears that come unbidden thus and free
  Have banished care and brought you back to me.




THE PROMISE OF SPRING


  Today resplendent in red, grays and gold,
  No wind disturbs the calm of Winter's rest,
  But quiet and serene on earth's broad breast
  Is shrub and bush and seed in loamy hold;
  The buds on elm are waiting to unfold,
  Our biddie hen wears crimson on her crest.
  This gorgeous day, when children laugh and jest,
  And run and dance and not a thought withhold.

  For Winter's frost was gone at early noon.
  We know that Spring will come on southern breeze;
  The grass will green and roses bloom again.
  We love the flowers, summer warmth and boon,
  O joy of earth, in green and swaying trees,
  In buds and bees on this broad prairie plain.




THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN


  O hallowed charm of long departed days;
  The good and bad blend in a sparkling stream.
  If one recalls youth's glad and care free ways;
  The distant roar of music is supreme,
  When viewing life's almost forgotten trail.
  There is a stream that twines its way about
  Through shady spots, by broken, rotted rail.
  The falling water glitters, and the trout,
  Again, like precious memories, flash and dart.
  Through bleak and cold, a precipice once crossed
  Still fills with pride and pain the aging heart;
  For time has now the thorns and rocks embossed,
  And thus the long dead past is always bright,
  For those whose sun is sinking into night.




ROLLING TRUCKS


  Rolling over desert sands
  Steady there are dough-boy's hands.
  Gliding past the silver sage
  Caring naught for fame or wage;
  Rolling trucks for Uncle Sam,
  In his kit are bread and ham.
  Slipping over moon-lit dunes
  Humming low the old men's tunes.
  Every moment plays the game,
  Like an iron in a flame.
  Rolling over desert sands,
  Steady there are dough-boy's hands.




AT DUSK


  A low blue cloud lies stretched beyond the trees,
  All quiet so. The chant of birds uplifts,
  And through the evening dusk a tremor sifts,
  The chill of night creeps close with turning keys,
  And darkness soothes each child. The daylight flees,
  Though many voices lend their artful gifts,
  And mingle with the city's murmured rifts.
  While twilight covers all with mysteries,
  There is the roll of train or army truck;
  A mother calls her three year old within.
  The most of us preparing for the night;
  Some go their way to labor for their luck,
  And others toil that we may rest or spin.
  God guards the whole until the morning light.




THE MORNING


  The morning freshened with the dew of night,
  Was glad with crowing cock and singing bird;
  And through the mists came hope and kindly word.
  The east aglow with early amber light.
  As perking coffee roused the hungry sprite;
  Beside the hearth a friendly pussy purred,
  And in a crib a blue-eyed baby stirred,
  Awakened from sweet slumber of the night.
  O dawning! Here with all her usual charm.
  Another day to toil for child and friend,
  One hour to praise our God, while hatreds ebbed;
  To hope and live and succor from all harm
  Those weaker ones who know not how to fend,
  And cast a beam that lights their way ahead.




O RIVER BANK


  I love to loiter by the old oak tree,
  Where waters ripple over clean white stones,
  And cresses, mint with feathered fern grown high.
  In such a place the peaceful thoughts will come;
  There is no hurry there where nature plays.
  Soft gentle breezes wave the grass and sedge;
  White fluffy clouds pass overhead and roll.
  Now dreaming, I hear the cricket's gay song.
  O river bank you charm me always so.




THERE WILL COME A DAY


  There will come a day, sometime,
  When a bright light will shine through
  The clouds of darkness, sometime.
  And the grass will grow anew;
  Glad bells will ring at the dawn;
  And at noon great horns will blow;
  At evening fear will be gone;
  The home lights through dusk will glow.
  It will be a joyous day!
  And the earth will shout with laughter,
  When world peace is made, some day.
  We can hear the birds thereafter.




LATE AUTUMN


  The fragrant autumn winds float painted leaves
  Across the plains at sunset's evening hour,
  A scarlet rose, a zinnia in the flower
  Stand brilliant there beneath the cottage eaves.
  The locust hums his song, the spider weaves
  His silken web in every shady bower,
  Where thunder clouds pile high in tumbled tower;
  The farmer's loft is bursting with great sheaves;
  And cornstalks bend with heavy golden loads,
  For rains have blessed the land the summer long.
  Now children trip on winding trails from school;
  They swing in rhythmic time along the roads;
  A hungry, hearty crowd, suntanned and strong.
  This glorious fall day in evening cool.




ALL HAIL RED CROSS


  All hail Red Cross! White robes of light, all hail!
  On brave and noble brows the symbol shines.
  A cry for help is never called in vain,
  For these courageous ones go everywhere,
  On sea or land, in sun and stormy sky.
  They face all dangers--carry succor forth
  To save their fellowmen--with speed and skill
  The aid goes out to rescue friend and foe.
  They know no enemy but heed each call.
  A line is thrown to stranded waif or man.
  In flood they rush like water down the slope
  To bring relief to those who toss in waves.
  They care for mothers left to starve, alone.
  In pestilence, they labor long to soothe
  The fevered brow and ease the gnawing pain
  With medicine and shelter, food and clothes.
  In war the wound is dressed and duly nursed
  With gentle supple hands--with nourishment
  For mind and body. Cross of red, all hail!
  They serve for us most willingly and well.
  Then chide themselves when they have come too late!
  Like mothers when their sons have fallen short;
  In early dawn and through the night they toil.
  O God do bless this noble work of love;
  Let's give and further this most worthy cause.
  All hail Red Cross! White robes of hope, all hail!




OUR MORNING PRAYER


  God our Father give us strength
  In these days of selfish strife,
  Let us smile amid the pain,
  Now to meet the care of life
  In the sunshine and in rain.




SOLDIER TO HIS MOTHER


  Remembering those happy days of youth--
  The earth was filled with gladness then,
  And you, dear Mother, taught me love and truth,
  Taught me to seek the best in men.

  With heart full of faith and noble thought
  To bear my load and do good deeds.
  And cherish worthy things, the hope not bought,
  With visions for the living needs.

  You said be honest with my God and soul,
  Devoted to my land and home,
  And all that men hold dear. In loyalty
  Respect and prize the fertile loam.

  Today my country calls, she needs her son
  To fight the Japs and Hitler too.
  No coming back until the job is done.
  This is as honest men would do.




IN THE STORM


  Hear the gale roaring through the woods!
    Trees bend and snap and sway;
    They race and break on this dark day.
  If I could fashion some sturdy hoods
    To hold the storm at bay,
    Then trim and straight would all trees stay.
  But great trees knotted by winds' moods,
    Like men who face their care,
  Stand scarred yet stanch and bravely there.




TO US


  O petty trifles! Why cling to us so?
  Our time in doing small things quite consumed,
  And hearts protected like earth worms encased,
  Always singing childish songs, sol me do,
  And crawling safe in shady vales below,
  Like snails advancing, scoff and hurt endured,
  Dead there upon the rack, no port secured.
  O brother plant, some grains of corn will grow!
  The faithful farmer sows live fertile seed.
  Be not a grub but rise and stretch hands up
  When on the height reach down to troubled friend,
  And lift your fellowmen, toil not for greed.
  Wash out the grounds and fill the empty cup.
  The rose will bloom where rocky pathways wend.




THE FLY AND THE SPIDER


  The big black fly was in a sorry plight;
  She hung and dangled in a spider's web.
  It was too late to make a hurried flight.
  The sand is sifting and the tides will ebb.

  The spider then drew dose his silken thread,
  It was no use to ask the reason why.
  He only wished to eat and save his head,
  And he must catch his breakfast, or die.




HER GOOD BYE


  I love you, Darling, sweetheart mine,
  Our troth is pledged, O joy divine!
  With apple blossoms in my hair
  I hope and breathe a fervent prayer
  To keep my trust all down the years,
  And love you always through the tears.
  O heart of mine, my feet do sing
  As down the aisle into the Spring
  Of bursting bud and lilac time,
  Of budding trees and robin rhyme,
  So tenderly, Dear, I love you.
  In happiness I go with you
  Now in sunshine to follow on
  And into dark when you are gone.
  Then back again from misty night
  And at the dawn in coming light.
  At sunup when the Japs are caught
  You will come when the battle's fought.
  And then glad shouts the whole day long,
  With ringing bells 'ten billion strong.




HILLS AND VALLEYS WAKE


  My ears have heard the larks at dawn,
  Their bright sweet carols sing,
  With burst of morning sun
  And all the meadows ring.

  My eyes have seen the shining gold,
  That rimmed a purple cloud,
  And sheets of olive green there spread,
  While night puts on a shroud.

  And in the east a moon that gleamed
  With grey blue light and sheen,
  On misty, drooping willow trees,
  O fair and silent scene.

  These are not half the things I see
  On lovely nights and brilliant days,
  It seems that hills and valleys wake
  To make such holidays.




MORNING THANKSGIVING


  We thank our God this Autumn day,
  As birds are waking in the vale,
  For health and strength to walk his way,
  Let justice and peace prevail.
  And for this food that's waiting here,
  Now fill our hearts with faith and love;
  And bless our loved ones far and near,
  O God, our Father up above.




OFF TO THE WOODS


  All nature dons a cool green coat,
  Soft breezes blow and white clouds float;
  The blue jay screams his piercing note.

  The April sun shines fine today,
  And all the world is bright and gay.
  Small twinkling leaves now dance and play!

  The Spring has made a grand debut;
  And turned up sod is reddish blue,
  Where last year's roses bloomed for you.

  And to the woods then let us hie
  To gather sorrel for a pie,
  And pick some posies from the rye.

  O Daughter come, a walk is free,
  Lock up the house and bring the key;
  For sing we must in joy and glee.




THE HAPPY CAMPERS


  Burning brush
  In morning hush
    While bacon fragrance floats.

  Daylight dreams
  Along bright streams
    With knapsack and light coats.

  Wind blown hair,
  They march and share
    And sing the happy notes.




THE PROMISE


  O Glendolyn, the life of my being,
  O Darling, the good in your heart!
  Bright eyes in the flash of a moment
  Grow sad as the time nears to part,
  Tears well in the midst of the laughter,
  Unbidden as the showers in Spring.
  Although the days cloud, but after
  The future will brighten and sing.

  O Glendolyn, weep not at my going,
  The weary long hours will pass;
  And dawn with its flame and a promise
  Will touch the grey sod and dry grass.
  The elm in the garden will flower
  And the hills on the plains be shining.
  That day, then the battle is over,
  I will come with swift feet, my Darling.




IN REFLECTION


  In the morning of my youth
  When my veins were full of strength
  There was Dad and Mom to say
  What to do. They spoke at length.

  Did I listen to the truth?
  Much of it has passed me by.
  Now if only some one would
  Speak to me and tell me why.




MEN MUST TOIL


  We wakened in the morning
  The wind had blown up cold;
  And too, the oaks were grumbling
  Like men agrowing old.

  We must all work this morning,
  Though rough and harsh outside,
  Men labor in the storming
  For all must eat betide.




THAT CLOSE DRAWN VEIL


  If we could lift that close drawn veil and see,
  The anxious hours might pass in rest and sleep.
  But wait! Could men but sow and counting reap?
  Who would toil on when knowing loss must be?
  No wild glad hoping with expectancy!
  And wooing lover then might he not weep?
  The fortune which would grieve--no shop to keep.
  Enough. Man can climb higher and be free.
  Leave be the veil and let men struggle through.
  Let roots strike down and seek the growing needs;
  And living stock stretch up toward the sun
  With life and hope. Then let men work and woo,
  Not anchorless, nor tumbling drift as weeds.
  Fulfilment in the end and laurel won.




OUR MORNING LESSON


  Love our neighbors as ourselves,
  May we fit in where we can,
  Love our God and praise his name
  Is God's law for mortal man.




WHEN THE BOYS COME HOME


  Bright smiles and many tear drops
    Are begging loved ones stay;
  For not all soldier boys come home
    When bugles call today.

  Brave lassies wait, toiling, hoping,
    And keep the hearth brushed clean,
  The home fires glowing brightly
    With all about serene.

  The heart grows weary often,
    For hours and days are long.
  But when the fight is over
    The land will ring with song.

  With all the maidens singing
    The full and happy notes,
  While men go shouting, marching,
    At sight of khaki coats.

  And Main Street pushing, crowding,
    Will be a surging stream,
  For when this war is over
    Our joy will be supreme.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
