THE COMPLETE FILM ACTOR.

[Illustration: "ARE YOU A GOOD PUGILIST?"]

Mr. Percy Garrick Smithers, actor, finding the path to fame less
smooth on the legitimate stage than he believed it to be by the Cinema
route, went to a producer of film plays and offered his services.

"Yes," said the producer, "I might possibly give you lead in a big
sensational I am about to put up. Are you a good pugilist?"

"I have indulged a little in the pastime of sparring," answered Percy.

"Good," said the producer. "You see, the picture opens with Bill
Bloodred, the champion prize-fighter, demanding certain documents from
his aged uncle. As the latter won't surrender the papers. Bill gives
him a swinging blow to the jaw, a few more heavy ones to various other
parts of the body, and then proceeds to kick the old man to death as
the latter lies helpless on the floor. It's one of those thrilling
scenes the juveniles like so much! Then _you_ come in and tackle
Bill."

"Quite so," said Percy.

"A terrific fight ensues. Bill surpasses anything he has ever done
in the ring, and it goes on until at last you collapse. Bill escapes,
leaving you for dead. Do you catch the idea?"

"Pretty well," said Percy.

[Illustration: "IT IS YOURSELF _VERSUS_ THE POLICE."]

"Now Bill goes straight away to the police office and states that
you have murdered his uncle. When you come to, you are surrounded by
about twenty members of the police force, the chief of whom slips the
handcuffs over your wrists. With one wrench you snap the chain and are
free!"

"With _one_ wrench?" asked Percy, to be sure he was getting the
details correctly.

"With one wrench. Then ensues another big struggle. This time it is
yourself _versus_ the police."

"The twenty?"

"Quite right. After some time you show signs of weakening, and the
police look like getting the upper hand."

"Ah!" remarked Percy.

"But just then Mignon, the old man's daughter, emerges from behind
a screen. She tells the police the facts and proclaims your absolute
innocence."

"Good!" said Percy.

[Illustration: "YOU ARE SEEN FALLING, FALLING, FALLING."]

"The chief of the police thereupon shakes you by the hand and
apologises. You indicate that it will now be your life's work to bring
the assassin, Bill, to justice, and then you quit. I should mention
that before leaving you fall in love with Mignon, and promise that
on your return you'll marry her at once. That parting scene will
want a bit of acting. Your countenance must show successive degrees
of pain, as if you had eaten something that was disagreeing with
your digestion; and you mustn't omit the most effective suffering
expression of all--chin raised, mouth open, eyelids closed
tightly--just as if you were about to sneeze. You'll find your
experience on the stage quite useful, you know."

"Oh, quite, quite," agreed Percy.

"Now you are out in the street. You seize the first motor-car at
hand, and start off on the grand hunt after Bill. Through the crowded
streets, out into the country highway, you fly at a terrific speed.
Up the mountain passes you race, down precipitous slopes with
every-increasing momentum. Every moment, it seems, will be your last.
But you come safely through."

"Certainly," said Percy.

"That is to say--almost. Unfortunately, in turning a sharp corner, the
car plunges into the waters of a rapid mountain torrent!"

"Dear, dear!" said Percy.

"But you come safely through--"

Percy heaved a sigh of relief.

[Illustration: "YOU FOLLOW HIM."]

"You are seen falling, falling, falling, still in your car, with the
descending cataract. Over and over you are turned in the seething
waters, dashed against rocks, hurled through ravines, and finally you
are given a sheer drop down a perpendicular waterfall of three hundred
feet. Out of the white foam formed in the bed of the waters you emerge
swimming strongly hand over hand, until at last you reach the broad
waters of the placid river, and finally the shore. Here you notice a
train passing some little distance away, and in it, gazing out of one
of the windows, you observe--Bill, the murderer! You at once start in
pursuit; by a superb effort you catch up the train, and just succeed
in swinging yourself safely on board. You can do a little sprinting, I
suppose?"

"I could give an ordinary train a bit of a start, no doubt," said
Percy with confidence.

"Just so," pursued the producer. "And now you find yourself
confronting the miscreant, Bill. The train is passing through a city.
It is on the elevated railway. Bill makes a dash for the door, springs
out, and lands on the roof of a house. You follow him--your leap being
considerably greater, because between his jump and yours the train has
proceeded a certain distance."

"Precisely," said Percy.

"Now there is a scramble over the roof-tops. You climb up pipes, slide
down slates, leap across spaces between separate houses, cling to
coping stones, and all that sort of thing."

"I grasp the idea," said Percy.

[Illustration: "HE CUTS THE WIRES ON WHICH YOU ARE CROSSING."]

"At last Bill is seized with a notion. He throws himself on to the
telephone wires, and, hanging by his hands, manages to convey himself
across to the houses on the opposite side of the road. You imitate
him. As Bill arrives on the other side, he turns and cuts the wires
on which you are crossing. Before the ends of the wires fall, however,
you turn a quick somersault and land beside Bill. Once more there is
a race over the roofs until Bill reaches a factory chimney. Down the
shaft he dives. So do you. Into the furnace below, then out of it, the
chase continues--it doesn't pause for a moment."

"Not a moment," echoed Percy as in a trance.

[Illustration: "THE LAST SCENE OF ALL WILL BE YOUR WEDDING."]

"Yes, it does, for you and Bill have dragged out of the furnace some
of the burning coal; this has caught some inflammable material, and
soon the whole factory is alight. Now you rush round to alarm the
workers. And what do you find? Mignon! She had gone out into the world
to earn her own bread, and had found employment in this factory. The
manager of the factory, an arch villain, had noted Mignon's beauty,
and just as you arrive he is dragging her away. You snatch Mignon
from his grasp. At that moment Bill comes up, takes in the situation,
seizes the treacherous manager, and flings him into the devouring
flames. Then Bill assists you to carry Mignon through the suffocating
smoke out to safety, but as you disappear the now dying manager draws
his revolver and fires after you. You are struck by the bullet,
but bear up until, with Bill's help, you have brought Mignon out of
danger. Then you faint away."

"Not till then?" said Percy.

"No, not till then. The last scene of all will be your wedding at the
church. Mignon, of course, is the bride, and Bill is your best man.
You see, he retrieved his character by the aid given at the factory
fire, and you have forgiven him the murder of his uncle. Oh, and, by
the way, you wouldn't have to be _really_ shot at the rehearsals, you
know."

"That's fine!" said Percy. "When would you like me to start?"

"A week from now."

"Good. That will give me a nice opportunity to get fit, and to have
one last good time in case any unforeseen mishap should occur in the
course of rehearsal. Of course I see no reason whatever to anticipate
any accident, but they have been known to happen under circumstances
even more commonplace, if that were possible."

  This year at ease on Ben Macquhair
    Couches a certain stag;
  Fearless he sniffs his native air
  Because he knows I can't be there
    To scare him off his crag.

  This year his instinct (true, though dumb)
    Tells him by subtle signs
  No bullet loosed by me shall come
  Shattering earth below his tum
    Or whistling through his tines.

  Yet little knows he why the hill
    Misses my wonted feet,
  Or how I've learned a lethal skill
  At mimic butts that bodes him ill
    When next I stalk his beat.

  I trow that he would swoon for fright
    Upon the purple ling
  To know that in a decent light
  I'd undertake the death, at sight,
    Of any living thing.

  O not for nothing do I grow
    Efficient, eye and hand,
  Schooling myself to strike a blow
  In home defence against a foe
    That never means to land.

  Some fruit of toil there yet shall be
    For this poor volunteer;
  When War's abatement sets him free
  From bloodless duties, I foresee
    A deadly time for deer!

Like the enemy, Mr. Punch also has projected himself "in front of the
front," and, in a moment of prophetic inspiration, anticipated the
following account, from the pen of his Special Correspondent, of a
_post-bellum_ competition on the St. Helena links:--

"The life of our royal captives in the internment camp at St. Helena
is the subject of a report from the Governor of the Island, which was
issued last night as a Purple Paper. The Governor, after dealing with
general matters, writes:--

[Illustration: CROWN PRINCE "THROWS BAG OF CLUBS AFTER THE BALL."

'In the interests of health I have permitted the less exalted members
of the camp to lay out a small golf course within the enclosed area,
and yesterday the links were declared open, the ceremony taking the
form of a four-ball competition, in which the German CROWN PRINCE was
partnered with FRANCIS-JOSEPH of Austria against FERDINAND of Bulgaria
and MEHMED of Turkey. Although present at the proceedings I feel that
I cannot do better than include in my report an account of the contest
which appeared in _The St. Helena Sentinel_.'"

Extract from _St. Helena Sentinel_:--

"_Internment Camp, 3 p.m._--CROWN PRINCE, who plays slashing reckless
game, takes honour at first hole (Liege to Loos), hooks at right
angles, dents two spectators, and ends up in Aisne Bunker. FERDINAND
(canny, cautious type of player) hits a wind-cheating screamer
which finished fully forty yards from the tee. Critics differ as to
FRANCIS-JOSEPH's shot, and it is still a moot point whether he had a
species of fit or was simply trying to follow through. When restored
to perpendicular was found to have ball deeply embedded in his person.
Disqualified for handling. MEHMED (a left-hander; uses clubs with
scimitar-shaped shafts) puts his drive over short slip into the
club-house kitchen. C.P., after converting Aisne Bunker into mine
crater, picks up. M., hopelessly bunkered in the Irish Stew, also
picks up. F. holes out in a stealthy nineteen. Bulgar-Turk Combine one
up.

_2nd Hole_ (_Ypres Salient--120 yards pitch_).--FRANCIS-JOSEPH,
strongly urged by Czech backers to use his foot instead of his clubs,
heels out in seventeen and squares the match. (Sensation.)

_3rd hole_ (_Czernowitch to Brest-Litowski_).--CROWN PRINCE, taking
the Przaritczow-Blokhod-Strypovitchi line, puts long-range shot into
the Pripet Marches. MEHMED, after undermining greater part of the
Bukowina, reports progress from the tee. FRANCIS-JOSEPH, reverting
to clubs, misses tee-shot twenty-four times and retires exhausted to
bath-chair. FERDIE's wind-cheater, badly sliced, trickles into the
Warsaw whins and is lost. C.P., arrived at edge of Pripet Marshes,
drops another ball, tops it into hazard, throws bag of clubs after it,
and sends for another set. Hole abandoned, M. having taken thirty-nine
shots and a life-line to get out of the Blokhod Swamp.

[Illustration: "FIRST-HAND EXHIBITION OF FRIGHTFULNESS."]

_4th Hole_ (_Kilimanjaro to Tanganyika_).--CROWN PRINCE drives out of
bounds twelve times, gives away second set of clubs and sends for
a third. FRANCIS-JOSEPH, attempting the Smuts Smash from edge
of Usambara Bunker, over-balances into hazard and is partially
suffocated. FERDINAND is disqualified for pushing on the green. MEHMED
holes his tee shot. (Uproar.) Orientals one up.

_5th Hole_ (_Douaumont to Verdun--long heart-breaking test of
golf_.)--CROWN PRINCE gives first-hand exhibition of frightfulness and
cuts down caddy with a niblick, the miserable fellow having coughed
as C.P. was about to drive. MEHMED, who is now taking a larger size in
fezzes by reason of performance at last tee, puts eight new balls into
the Meuse Burn and gives up. FRANCIS-JOSEPH, still too full of sand
to play hole, awaits arrival of vacuum-cleaner. FERDINAND, after twice
exploiting the Big Push brassie shot, is suspended for cutting the
cloth. C.P. abandons hole (or what is left of it) after missing
two-inch putt.

5_p.m._--Match all square at the turn. Exhaustive search now being
made for MEHMED, who was last seen (and heard) seeking his ball in the
Mametz Wood. Ominous silence for past five minutes. Grave reason to
fear that he has cut down entire wood upon himself.

5.30 _p.m._--MEHMED rescued from _debris_ but will take no further
part in contest, following match on a stretcher. FRANCIS-JOSEPH now
shows signs of extreme exhaustion and plays all shots from bath-chair.
FERDINAND, who asserts himself a match for both his opponents, won
tenth hole (Helles Hell--hundred-yards carry over dense undergrowth)
with brassie shot that ricochetted off five spectators and two trees,
finishing up three inches from the pin. By careful putting he got down
in two more. CROWN PRINCE has just thrown away third set of clubs.

[Illustration: "A BRILLIANT RUN-THROUGH CANNON."]

6 _p.m._--FRANCIS-JOSEPH has retired. Can no longer swing a club, and
has booked bed in camp hospital. CROWN PRINCE still awaiting fresh set
of clubs. Will now play FERDINAND a single.

6.15 _p.m._--FERDINAND, who has been granted permission to cue on the
greens, has just won eleventh hole by a brilliant run-through cannon
off CROWN PRINCE's ball.

6.30 _p.m._--FERDINAND has retired.

7.10 _p.m._--FERDINAND has retired about two miles. Cause of
withdrawal occurred on fourteenth green, when F. mis-cued and blamed
CROWN PRINCE's shadow. C.P., in his frightfulness, struck F. savagely
in the face with a baffy and threw F.'s rubber tee into Salonika Pond.
When F. remonstrated, C.P. took the offensive and F. was forced to
yield ground. When last seen was yielding ground rapidly and in danger
of having his lines of communication cut.

[Illustration: "TAKING A LARGER SIZE IN FEZZES."]

7.50 _p.m._--CROWN PRINCE to continue _solus_. Going out for record of
the course.

8.10 _p.m._--Record abandoned, CROWN PRINCE having thrown away or
broken every available club in the St. Helena Sector."

_Governor's report_ (_resumed_).--"In the not too sanguine hope
that my prisoners will one day grasp the meaning of the term
'Sportsmanship,' I have given my consent to the holding of a
cricket-match at an early date. I am reliably informed that in
HINDENBURG the Austro-German XI. has a remarkable bowler of the googly
order. On some of the Riga grounds, when two feet in mud, he was quite
unplayable. FERDINAND, who will captain the other side, is very fast
for several overs, though his action is not above suspicion. Great
efforts are being made to get FRANCIS-JOSEPH to keep wicket. I trust
to include an account of the match in a subsequent report."

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
