PREFACE.


Each volume of a successful periodical miscellany resembles Seneca's
"one good turn--a shoeing-horn to another;" and the Editor of THE
MIRROR, in prefacing his _tenth volume_ with this comparison, hopes
that he does not over-rate what the present patronage of the public
encourages him to expect. Indeed, he would fear the suspicion
of ingratitude on his part, were he not thus to acknowledge the
long-extended success which has attended his labours, from their
commencement to the present moment. At the same time, lest vanity
should be thought to have mastered his better judgment, he assures
his patrons that he does not claim the undivided merit of his good
fortune; since, beyond his own taste of adaptation and selection,
he "misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on;" so that, the
multiplicity of his resources being considered, his success is,
perhaps, more complimentary to the discernment of the public, than it
is laudatory of his individual exertions.

As many readers would yawn over a long preface like so much Latin,
the Editor will not, in the present instance, subject them to so
extraordinary a stretch of _ennui_, by any lengthy comment on the
character of his last volume. He hopes that its contents will be
found equal to either of its predecessors; and, if any superiority be
observed, he begs that it may be attributed to the "march of mind," in
whose rank and file he may be allowed his proper order.

Like the well-graced actor, who, at the conclusion of a play, bows
to the performers before he addresses the audience, the Editor first
returns his acknowledgments to his several Correspondents, who _have
contributed_ to the public entertainment in his last volume: perhaps
this class may be very small, although in the usual proportion of
good and evil which is scattered up and down all paths of life. To the
other and more numerous class, _viz._ those whose Communications (from
various motives, generally explained) have not been inserted, the
Editor is equally indebted,--for intention, if not accomplishment; and
he hopes that the performance of his critical duty has been such as
to conciliate their respect and good-will. As a pleasantry, he would
remind a fair proportion of his readers, that,

        As the young and forward bud
  Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
  Even so by love the young and tender wit
  Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,
  Losing his verdure even in the prime,
  And all the fair effects of future hopes--

for he would not affect the fickle guide on so extended a scale.
For graver matters, or such as are beyond the surface of the heart,
the Editor thanks his Correspondents on subjects of _Art_, in its
antiquarian and modern departments, of whose researches he has
frequently availed himself. With a view to keep pace with the Spirit
of Philosophical Discovery which characterizes the present day, the
Editor has been his own Prometheus in introducing his readers to the
"_Arcana of Science_," the object of which has already been fully
explained, and he hopes, to a certain extent, realized.

The Editor is not disposed to indulge too freely in anticipation, lest
he should lose sight of his object: accordingly, he must be brief in
his professions for the future. Improvement is contemplated in the
general execution of the Embellishments, as far as the Proprietor
and Editor have control; but, anon, they will be at the bar of public
taste. To use a parliamentary phrase, other new "features" will be
introduced from time to time, so as to continue to reflect in THE
MIRROR the characteristics and curiosity of the present day, aided by
some of the bright lights of past ages.

MEMOIR

OF

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CLARENCE,

_LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND._

       *       *       *       *       *

  Ye sacred arks of Liberty! that float
  Where Tamar's waters spread their bosom wide,
  That seem, with towering stern and rampart stride,
  Like antique castles girt with shining moat:
  Should War the signal give with brazen throat,
  No more recumbent here in idle pride,
  Your rapid prows would cleave the foaming tide,
  And to the nations speak in thundering note.
  Thus in the firmament serene and deep,
  When summer clouds the earth are hanging o'er,
  And all their mighty masses seem asleep,
  To execute Heaven's wrath, and judgment sore,
  From their dark wombs the sudden lightnings leap,
  And vengeful thunders peal along the shore.

            _Forget Me Not_--for 1828.

The recent appointment of the above illustrious individual to the
head of our naval administration is a gratulatory topic for every
Englishman; and we doubt not the measure will contribute as largely
to individual honour, as it will to the national welfare. In the
abstract, nations resemble large families, of which kings are fathers
or guardians; and the subdivision of this guardianship or paternal
government, among the sons or younger brothers of the sovereign is
calculated to promote unanimity among the governors, and to engraft
with affectionate loyalty the hearts of the governed. Indeed, the
tutelar presence of princes seldom fails to inspire courage, and to
support the patriotic sons of arms even in the extremes of danger;
and, although the princes of our times have seldom been distinguished
in the camp of war,--we should recollect that

  Nihil sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi.

The DUKE of CLARENCE, who is next brother to his present Majesty, was
born at St. James's Palace, August 21, 1765, at a quarter before four
in the morning, and in the following month was baptized by the name of
WILLIAM HENRY. It is said that in his childhood and youth, it was the
frankness of his countenance and behaviour induced the king to devote
him to the naval service: added to this, he surpassed his brothers
in corporeal strength and constitutional hardihood; although he was
exceeded by them in the more refined acquirements of study, to which
he manifested comparative indifference. With a mind naturally framed
for peril and enterprise, and aware of the subordinate rank and
laborious stations through which he must pass to distinction, he
appears to have been enthusiastic and impatient for the service
long before he entered the lists, notwithstanding he commenced his
career at the age of fourteen, by joining the Prince George, a
ninety-eight-gun ship, recently built, and named after his present
majesty. In this ship, under the command of Admiral Digby, his royal
highness bore a part in the great naval engagement between the English
and Spanish fleets, commanded by Admiral Rodney and Don Juan de
Langara. Previous to his leaving the Prince George, he was also
present at the capture of a French man-of-war and three smaller
vessels, forming part of a considerable convoy; but in neither of
these instances was an opportunity offered for any distinguishing
effort of bravery. On this occasion, the Spanish admiral, Don Juan
de Langara, on visiting Admiral Digby, was introduced to his royal
highness. During the conference between the two admirals the prince
retired, and when it was intimated that Don Juan wished to return,
his royal highness appeared in the uniform of a midshipman, and
respectfully informed the admiral that the boat was ready. The
Spaniard was surprised to see the son of his Britannic majesty acting
in the capacity of an inferior officer, and emphatically observed to
Admiral Digby, "Well does Great Britain merit the empire of the seas,
when humble stations in her navy are filled by princes of the blood."

We have next the pleasing duty of adverting to two signal exertions of
his royal highness in the cause of humanity--conduct which

            is twice bless'd:
  It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:
  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
  The throned monarch better than his crown.

The first is thus narrated by a midshipman of the Torbay, in a letter
to his friends:--

    "_Port Royal Harbour, April_, 1783.

    "The last time Lord Hood's fleet was here, a court-martial
    was held on Mr. Benjamin Lee, midshipman, for disrespect to
    a superior officer, at which Lord Hood sat as president. The
    determination of the court was fatal to the prisoner, and he
    was condemned to death. Deeply affected as the whole body of
    the midshipmen were at the dreadful sentence, they knew not
    how to obtain a mitigation of it, since Mr. Lee was ordered
    for execution; while they had not time to make their appeal
    to the Admiralty, and despaired of success in a petition to
    Admiral Rowley. However, His Royal Highness generously stepped
    forth, drew up a petition, to which he was the first to set
    his name, and solicited the rest of the midshipmen in port to
    follow his example. He then himself carried the petition to
    Admiral Rowley, and in the most pressing and urgent manner,
    begged the life of our unhappy brother; in which he succeeded,
    and Mr. Lee is reprieved. We all acknowledge our warmest and
    grateful thanks to our humane, our brave, and worthy prince,
    who has so nobly exerted himself in preserving the life of his
    brother sailor."

In the same year, 1783, the prince, then a fine midshipman, visited
Cape Francois, and the Havannah, where the second instance of his
generous humanity occurred. It should be premised, that some of
his countrymen having broken their oath of fidelity to the Spanish
government, were in danger of suffering under sentence of death. The
governor of Louisiana, Don Galvez, offered, at the intercession of the
prince, to pardon them; and the enthusiasm which he manifested in this
"labour of love" cannot be better illustrated than by the following
letter addressed by his royal highness to the governor:--

    "Sir,--I want words to express to your Excellency my just
    sense of your polite letter, of the delicate manner in which
    you caused it to be delivered, and your generous conduct
    towards the unfortunate in your power. Their pardon, which
    you have been pleased to grant on my account, is the most
    agreeable present you could have offered me, and is strongly
    characteristic of the bravery and gallantry of the Spanish
    nation. This instance increases, if possible, my opinion of
    your Excellency's humanity, which has appeared on so many
    occasions, in the course of the late war.

    "Admiral Rowley is to dispatch a vessel to Louisiana for
    the prisoners. I am convinced they will ever think of your
    Excellency's clemency with gratitude; and I have sent a
    copy of your letter to the king my father, who will be fully
    sensible of your Excellency's attention to me.

    "I request my compliments to Madame Galvez, and that you will
    be assured that actions so noble as those of your Excellency
    will ever be remembered by

"Yours, sincerely, WILLIAM P."

On June 17, 1785, after a service afloat of six years and three
months, his royal highness was promoted lieutenant of the Hebe. In ten
months after this we find him serving as captain of the Pegasus; next
in the Andromeda and the Valiant; and on December 3, 1790, his royal
highness received a commission as rear-admiral of the blue, having
then been about eighteen months a peer of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, by the titles of duke of Clarence and St. Andrews, and earl
of Munster. From this period till the year 1814 his royal highness
remained on shore. On April 19, in that year, he hoisted his flag on
board the Jason, as admiral of the fleet; and on the 23rd of the same
month he sailed from Dover, with several other ships, to escort Louis
XVIII. to the coast of France; and having seen him to Calais, returned
to the Downs on the night of the 24th, and struck his flag a few days
after.[1]

During the period between the 25th of May and June 28th, 1814, (when
his royal highness finally took leave of the sea,) his flag was
hoisted, successively, in the Impregnable and Jason, and again in the
Impregnable, and from her transferred to the Magicienne; in which last
ship he sailed on the 26th of June, and having escorted the allied
sovereigns to the continent, struck his flag, and came on shore.[2]

His royal highness' service at sea may, therefore, be stated as
follows:--6 years as midshipman; 11 months as lieutenant; 3 years and
10 months as post captain; and 7 weeks as admiral of the fleet: making
a total service at sea of about 10 years and 9 months.[3]

The intimacy of the prince with the gallant Nelson is well known as
one of the most interesting incidents of the duke's life. They first
met at Quebec in 1782, when Nelson was in the Albemarle off that
station, and whence he was ordered to convoy a fleet of transports
to New York. From this time they became much attached, and their
separation was the cause of mutual regret. At the close of the war
they met again, both being appointed to the Leeward island station.
Nelson soon had an opportunity of witnessing the prince's resolute
obedience to orders, amidst great personal danger, and strong
temptations to avarice, the circumstances of which are briefly
as follow:--The law excluded all foreign vessels from trade and
intercourse with our West India islands; and America, being now
independent, and as much a foreign nation as any other, Nelson,
the senior captain on the station, ordered all American vessels to
quit the islands within forty-eight hours, on pain of seizure, and
prosecution of their owners. Four vessels at Nevis remained, which
he ordered to be searched, and on being found American, they were
adjudged legal prizes. This proceeding placed Nelson in considerable
difficulty, but he ultimately triumphed; and though the thanks of
government for protecting its commerce were given to the admiral of
the station, who had in fact opposed the measure, Nelson was conscious
of having done his duty, and enjoyed the approbation of such as were
disinterested witnesses of it. Among these was Prince William, who
thus notices Nelson's conduct on this occasion in a letter to a
friend: "It was at this era," says the prince, "that I particularly
observed the greatness of Nelson's superior mind. The manner in which
he enforced the spirit of the Navigation Act first drew my attention
to the commercial interests of my country. We visited different
islands together; and as much as the manoeuvres of fleets can be
described off the headlands of islands, we fought over again the
principal naval actions in the American war. Excepting the naval
tuition which I had received on board the Prince George, when the
present Rear Admiral Keats was lieutenant of her, and for whom we both
entertained a sincere regard, my mind took its first decided naval
turn from this familiar intercourse with Nelson."

It is also worthy of remark, that while the prince spoke thus highly
of Nelson, the latter estimated his royal highness in correspondent
terms. In a letter to Captain Locker, about the same period, Nelson
says, "You must have heard, long before this reaches you, that Prince
William is under my command. I shall endeavour to take care that he
is not a loser by that circumstance. He has his foibles as well as
private men, but they are far overbalanced by his virtues. In his
professional line he is superior to near two-thirds I am sure of
the list; and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior
officers, I hardly know his equal. His royal highness keeps up strict
discipline in his ship, and without paying him any compliment, she
is one of the finest ordered vessels I have seen." These opinions,
it should be recollected, are quoted from private correspondence--a
circumstance which adds materially to their value.

On July 11, 1818, his royal highness was married at Kew to her serene
highness Adelaide Amelia Louisa Theresa Caroline, princess of Saxe
Meinengen, eldest daughter of his serene highness the late reigning
duke of Saxe Meinengen. The ceremony, as is usual on these occasions,
was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the presence of
all the royal family. By this marriage his royal highness had one
daughter, who was born March 27, 1819, and died after a few hours. In
1823, his royal highness was made a general of marines; and within the
past year the duke has been appointed lord high admiral of England.

It is not our intention here to enter into the supposed causes of
the duke's long seclusion from public service, viz. from 1790 to the
present time, except a short interval in 1814. At the commencement of
the war with France, the late Duke of York took an early and active
part by land; hence the question arises as to the non-appointment of
the Duke of Clarence to a similar position by sea. The consequence has
been, that the most vigorous portion of the duke's life has been lost
to his country, whilst his royal highness has remained in comparative
obscurity, amidst one of the most brilliant periods of our naval
history. It is, however, gratifying to know that the duke's inactivity
cannot be attributed to apathy on his part. On the contrary, he was
anxious to be employed, and even sought appointment, as appears by the
following letter, written by his royal highness to Commodore Owen in
1812:--

"_Bath House, Saturday night._

    "DEAR SIR--This evening I received your letter from Deal,
    and in answer to it, I beg to observe, that I have made both
    a public and private application to the king, that I may be
    permitted to hoist my flag, and relieve Lord Collingwood in
    the command of his majesty's fleet in the Mediterranean. There
    cannot be any secrecy in this thing; because, before more
    than fifty brother officers, I declared my resolution at
    Portsmouth. Until I have the order to hoist my flag, I cannot
    be certain; but I am very much inclined to think eventually
    that I shall have the honour and the happiness of commanding
    those fine fellows whom I saw in the spring in the Downs, and
    lately at Portsmouth. My short stay at Admiral Campbell's had
    impressed me with very favourable ideas of the improved state
    of the navy; but my residence at Portsmouth has afforded me
    ample opportunity of examining, and consequently of having
    a perfect judgment of the high and correct discipline now
    established in the king's service. * * * I could not resist
    what I felt; and reasons, both public and private, urged me to
    make the offer I have already mentioned, and I hope I shall be
    gratified.--I remain, dear sir, yours, &c.

"WILLIAM."

These zealous sentiments are, however, further corroborated by a
recent declaration of the duke to the Goldsmiths' Company, on their
presenting him with the freedom of their society.

Having sketched the principal circumstances which appertain to what
may be termed the _public career_ of his royal highness, it is our
less pleasant, though equally important, duty, to notice his _domestic
life_; for obvious reasons our details will be less perfect. It is
a portion of the duke's life which cannot be entirely passed over in
silence, since it must be conceded, that much of his unpopularity may
be traced to this source. Neither the court nor the people of England
are so ascetic as not to extenuate the indiscretions of royalty; but
this charitable estimate of misgivings does not extend to approbation
of any culpable dereliction of social and moral duties. The fact of
his royal highness having a large family, by a lady now no more, is
too well known to be concealed; but the odium attached to his royal
highness for his participation in a certain scene of license and
poverty, has doubtless been over-rated; but his proportion must be
left for the biographer of a future age to settle; and we sincerely
hope that, to quote a contemporary, "when the time arrives that the
historian shall feel himself at liberty to enter into details, and
sift matters to the bottom, his royal highness will come out of the
investigation, (not without some blame, for which of us is faultless,
but) with a character unsullied _even in this respect_, and in
all other respects irreproachable." Mankind are, more or less, the
children of error; but their propensity to exaggerate human frailty
deserves to be reprobated for its cruelty and wickedness.

The happy marriage of his royal highness, to which event we have
already alluded, has, we trust, been the means of clearing away the
prejudices which the duke's former conduct may have engendered.

  There is a tide in the affairs of man,
  Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.

This period of his royal highness' life has probably arrived, and
his appointment to the important office of Lord High Admiral will
doubtless accelerate the beneficial effect. The public are perhaps
sanguine in their expectations; but from early and subsequent proofs
of the duke's devotion and attachment to the service over which he now
presides, we have reason to think they will not be disappointed. It
has been shown that his royal highness neither wanted zeal nor ability
at any stage of his life, and the ardent assurances which have been
quoted from one of his most recent declarations, bespeak that he still
possesses the vigour of manhood, tempered with experience; and it must
be truly gratifying to his royal highness to know that the honour and
authority of the office of Lord High Admiral, have been revived, after
the sleep of a century, as if to compensate him for past neglect, with
their investiture.[4] In truth, the alacrity with which the duke has
already entered into the duties of his office, and the lively sense of
justice he has manifested in dispensing its honorary rewards, must be
gladly hailed by the service, and the country at large.

His royal highness's present emoluments may be stated as follow:--

The Duke of York is acknowledged by Mr. Peel, in his speech, Feb. 17,
1827, to have had £50,000. a-year.

We subjoin the following characteristic anecdote from the New Sailor's
Magazine for December, 1827, sketched with fidelity and in that
rich vein of humour by which stories of the service are usually
distinguished. It exhibits the character of his royal highness in all
the glowing generosity of buoyant youth, and proves him to possess a
warm-hearted sympathy for the sufferings of his fellow-creatures--

THE ROYAL REEFER AND BOB CLEWLINES.

It was on one of those December days, when the wind, blowing from
the northward, acts almost like a razor on the surface of the skin,
and when, accompanied by small sharp rain, a mixture of damp and
cold produce a chilling effect upon the frame and spirits, that a
_ci-devant_ midshipman, his hands in his pockets, and

  "Whistling as he went for want of thought,"

crossed London-bridge, which at that time was an asylum to the
footsore, the pauper, and the weary of heart. The day had fallen, and
every thing looked dull and dreary; the foot-path was encumbered by
mud, and porters carrying weights, as well as other busy passengers,
were jostling each other to obtain a footing on the dirty pavement:
a fellow heavy laden came in contact with the _royal reefer_[6] so
powerfully, that he took a lee-lurch, and got foul of one of the seats
in the arches. "Avast there; luff up, you lubberly rigged son of a
gun," cried middy; "couldn't you hail ship before you were aboard of
us?" The fellow, however, waddled on; but the middy had to turn about
in order to regain his course, when suddenly he beheld a middle-aged
figure, perishing with cold, a red night-cap on, an old jacket and
trousers, a pair of shoes in rags attached to his legs with a rope's
end, no shirt, no stockings, nor any other attire; the face was
climate-struck, it had braved the equator and the pole, the battle
and the breeze, the scorching heat and the petrifying cold,--it was,
as might be expected, thin, and moreover almost lost in a profusion
of hair on each cheek, so that it would be difficult for the oldest
acquaintance to recognise the features after long absence; nature had
made the lips to smile, the eyes to beam in kindness, the fine high
forehead to command respect; but time and hardships, disease and
disappointment, had quenched the fire of the organ of sight and
intelligence, the mirror of the soul,--had prematurely furrowed that
front of honest English high spirit and candour, and had taught the
lips to fall in dejection and the treasured silence of woe: upon the
whole, the figure had something fierce in it, but it was truly manly;
the warrior's arms were folded together, and his face, bent towards
the ground, was still half up-turned, and seemed to say to rich
merchants and venders passing by on foot and in carriages, "There ye
are, ye liers upon beds of down, ye feeders upon the poor man's toil;
often have you slept secure, and safely enjoyed your wealth, whilst
poor Jack rode out the gale, hung on the rigging betwixt life and
death, and endured the storm which held him every moment betwixt
the chance of clinging to a fragment of the wreck and sinking into
eternity: but, now the war is over, smart-money paid for a sharp
wound, and neglect and oblivion, are the seaman's portion." The
expression of his face and eyes seemed to speak thus; indeed, it spoke
volumes; but its mute appeal was lost on the worldlings, who brushed
by him, and who, bent on love of gain, scarcely were aware that their
fellow-man was starving by their side, too feeble and too much an
outcast to work, yet too proud to beg; the middy's heart, however, was
of that texture that it leant towards a brother-sailor, meet him where
it might, and he naturally looked round at poor Jack on his beam-ends:
he had but one penny in his pocket, and that the plaintive voice of
a blind woman had drawn, as if by magic, from its deep recess. What
was to be done?--for he should have liked to have taken this wreck of
_a man of war into tow_. The reflection caused him to examine more
closely the shivering seaman, when a small scar, occasioned by a
splinter, on the _bridge of the nose_, brought to his remembrance Bob
_Clewlines_, who had served in the same ship: the tar recognised him
also; but, so far from making himself known to him, he hid his face
in his hand: the reefer, however, was resolved to bring him to. "What,
Bob Clewlines!" cried he, "do I not hail an old shipmate in you, a
quarter-master on board the ----, the bravest heart of oak, the best
reefer, and the merriest steersman of the whole ship's crew; and,"
said he audibly, that every one passing might hear and value fallen
courage and fidelity, "and _as prime a seaman as ever trimmed a sail,
or served a gun_; why, what has broke up your old hulk this way?" The
man could not find utterance; remembrance of _unrequited services_
and other associations checked him. The middy stretched out his hand,
which the _broken-hearted sailor_ ventured not to take. "Come, Bob,"
cried the other, "no subordination now: we are all equals on life's
_quarter-deck_, and when my _fellow-man_ suffers, he _rises_ a peg in
my estimation. Why?--because _unfeeling lubbers_ slight him. Come tip
us your _fin_. Your hand may be dirty, but your soul is as kind as a
new sail in a sunny day. I'll show it against any lord's in the land.
Come, heave a head; follow me, old tarry breeches; I'll soon set your
_timbers_ and _rigging_ to rights; you shall have an entire refit.
Come, bear a hand; _set_ all your _canvass_; it's all in _ribbons_, I
see, and _shivers_ in the wind; but I'll keep out wind and weather for
you."

Thus saying, he walked proudly with the poor tar, astern of him, until
he came to a slop-shop, near Wellclose square: it was a Jew's. "Here,
Moses," quoth the middy, who detected the Israelite bending looks
of disdain and mistrust on the poor man, as if he considered the
contents of his shop in danger: "come, Moses, a regular built _outrig_
for this _gentleman_," laying great stress on the word gentleman.
This was _pitching_ it strong, but his heart was carrying _royals,
sky-scrapers, moon-rakers_, and his _pulse_ was _sailing_ at the rate
of _ten knots_ an hour at least; so elate was he to serve a brave man
in distress, and above all, a son of the ocean: "come, let us have
every thing good, and spic and span new."--"Pray, _Shair_, who's to
pay?"--"_Myshelf._"--"O, your honour, that's right." The poor man
retired to a back-room, and stepped forward clad from head to foot,
and with two changes of linen and a pair of shoes (by the midshipman's
order) tied up in a pocket-handkerchief under his arm. BOB CLEWLINES
looked with a blush on his old clothes, and at this moment an almost
naked boy passed by: the midshipman duly appreciated and truly
interpreted one look of the tar. "Bob, I say, heave that overboard,
and let the poor boy pick it up: one good turn deserves another."
The payment was the next. "Three pounds fifteen.--Is that the
lowest?"--"O, yesh: I don't gain five shillings by the whole
deal."--"Well, then, do you take the case of my gold watch, and weigh
it, and give me the produce of it."--"Let ush see: it's vary pretty,
but not vary heavy; it's all fashion you see: indeed, it's a great
pity to part, the vatch and the caish; watches are a drug now, or else
I'd buy it; but just to oblige you, I'll see what I can give."--"Don't
trouble yourself, Mosey; just do as you are bid: you take the outside
case, and I'll keep the watch."--"I shall lend you four pounds upon
it," resumed the Israelite; "and you may depend upon my honour to
return it to you, when you bringsh me de monish."--"No, you
won't, Mosey; you'll do just what I bid you."--"It will spoil the
watch"--"Not a bit; she must work without her _jacket_, as my friend
has often done in all weathers. I shall sell the outside case to serve
a shipmate in distress; but the watch was left me by a dear friend,
so I shall keep her: a metal case will do as well for a little
time, and when fortune's breeze springs up again, _the case will
be altered_."--"Vel, shair, you shall be obeyed: five pounds, five
shillings is just the price of the weight; there's the money."--"Good
morning, Master Moses; but do you, _Clewlines_, set sail again; I
want to get you into port: it is only what I owe you. Were you not the
kindest creature to me in the world _when I was confined to my berth
with the yellow fever, and not expected to live a day?_ Come, come,
you must take your cargo in; you must be _victualled_ as well as
_refitted_. I have got a chalk at a house near this,--another shipmate
who is set up in business in a public line: call for what you want,
and here's the loose change to keep your pocket until something turns
up." Poor Bob got a _good dinner_, a _good bed_, and a _snug hammock_,
that night; and shortly afterwards he obtained a birth in an Indiaman,
and is now doing well. The royal reefer's heart bounded with joy at
performing this noble action to recover which he put himself for a
month on short allowance. But this is only one of many such traits
in the character of this heart of oak whose name the writer could
scarcely venture to state, but who will here remember this scene.

By way of a _tail-piece_ to this already extended memoir, we present
our readers with an accurate engraving of

THE ROYAL CLARENCE CUP,

[Illustration]

given by the gentlemen of the Thames Yacht Club, in honour of his
royal highness the Lord High Admiral having condescended to become the
patron of the club, on Thursday September 27, 1827. A steam packet was
engaged, to accompany the match, by the Club for the accommodation of
their friends, among whom we had the good fortune to be numbered. It
was altogether a most grateful relaxation from our land labours. The
distance sailed was from off Blackwall to Gravesend and back, and
the muster of the fleet almost unprecedentedly fine. The whole of the
vessels were admirably managed throughout, the match, which towards
the close, became intensely interesting. At length it was decided
by the _Lady Louisa_, (Mr. Thomas Smith, owner) arriving first at
Blackwall, distancing eight others, but gaining the victory with only
a few minutes to spare. If we recollect "right well," the day was
fine for the advanced period of the season, and on board the several
vessels packets, and on the banks of the river, there were the usual
humours of an aquatic spectacle without any of its vulgarisms. The
cup, weighing 85 oz. and standing nearly two feet high, is of silver,
elegantly chased, and as our engraving imports, of classical design;
and its exhibition, with the customary ceremony of presentation,
toasting, &c. appeared to afford much satisfaction to the assembled
company, and the victorious claimant of the prize, and equal credit to
the taste of the artist, Mr. Hyams.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
