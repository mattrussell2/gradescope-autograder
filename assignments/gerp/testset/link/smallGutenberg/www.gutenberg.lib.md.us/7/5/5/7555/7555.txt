QUOTES AND IMAGES: CONFESSIONS OF ROUSSEAU




CONFESSIONS OF ROUSSEAU


By Jean Jacques Rousseau




A feeling heart the foundation of all
my misfortunes

A religion preached by such
missionaries must lead to paradise!

A subject not even fit to make a priest
of

A man, on being questioned, is
immediately on his guard

Adopted the jargon of books, than the
knowledge they contained

All animals are distrustful of man, and
with reason

All your evils proceed from yourselves!

An author must be independent of
success

Ardor for learning became so far a
madness

Aversion to singularity

Avoid putting our interests in
competition with our duty

Being beat like a slave, I judged I had
a right to all vices

Bilboquet

Catholic must content himself with the
decisions of others

Caution is needless after the evil has
happened

Cemented by reciprocal esteem

Considering this want of decency as an
act of courage

Conversations were more serviceable
than his prescriptions

Degree of sensuality had mingled with
the smart and shame

Die without the aid of physicians

Difficult to think nobly when we think
for a livelihood

Dine at the hour of supper; sup when I
should have been asleep

Disgusted with the idle trifling of a
convent

Dissembler, though, in fact, I was only
courteous

Dying for love without an object

Endeavoring to hide my incapacity, I
rarely fail to show it

Endeavoring to rise too high we are in
danger of falling

Ever appearing to feel as little for
others as herself

Finding in every disease symptoms
similar to mine

First instance of violence and
oppression is so deeply engraved

First time in my life, of saying, "I
merit my own esteem"

Flattery, or rather condescension, is
not always a vice

Force me to be happy in the manner they
should point out

Foresight with me has always embittered
enjoyment

Hastening on to death without having
lived

Hat, only fit to be carried under his
arm

Have the pleasure of seeing an ass ride
on horseback

Have ever preferred suffering to owing

Her excessive admiration or dislike of
everything

Hold fast to aught that I have, and yet
covet nothing more

Hopes, in which self-love was by no
means a loser

How many wrongs are effaced by the
embraces of a friend!

I never much regretted sleep

I strove to flatter my idleness

I never heard her speak ill of persons
who were absent

I loved her too well to wish to possess
her

I felt no dread but that of being
detected

I was long a child, and am so yet in
many particulars

I am charged with the care of myself
only

I only wished to avoid giving offence

I did not fear punishment, but I
dreaded shame

I had a numerous acquaintance, yet no
more than two friends

Idea of my not being everything to her

Idleness is as much the pest of society
as of solitude

If you have nothing to do, you must
absolutely speak continually

In the course of their lives frequently
unlike themselves

In company I suffer cruelly by inaction

In a nation of blind men, those with
one eye are kings

Indolence, negligence and delay in
little duties to be fulfilled

Indolence of company is burdensome
because it is forced

Injustice of mankind which embitters
both life and death

Insignificant trash that has obtained
the name of education

Instead of being delighted with the
journey only wished arrival

Is it possible to dissimulate with
persons whom we love?

Jean Bapiste Rousseau

Knew how to complain, but not how to
act

Law that the accuser should be confined
at the same time

Left to nature the whole care of my own
instruction

Less degree of repugnance in divulging
what is really criminal

Letters illustrious in proportion as it
was less a trade

Loaded with words and redundancies

Looking on each day as the last of my
life

Love of the marvellous is natural to
the human heart

Make men like himself, instead of
taking them as they were

Making their knowledge the measure of
possibilities

Making me sensible of every deficiency

Manoeuvres of an author to the care of
publishing a good book

Men, in general, make God like
themselves

Men of learning more tenaciously retain
their prejudices

Mistake wit for sense

Moment I acquired literary fame, I had
no longer a friend

Money that we possess is the instrument
of liberty

Money we lack and strive to obtain is
the instrument of slavery

More stunned than flattered by the
trumpet of fame

More folly than candor in the
declaration without necessity

Multiplying persons and adventures

My greatest faults have been omissions

Myself the principal object

Necessity, the parent of industry,
suggested an invention

Neither the victim nor witness of any
violent emotions

No sooner had lost sight of men than I
ceased to despise them

No longer permitted to let old people
remain out of Paris

Not so easy to quit her house as to
enter it

Not knowing how to spend their time,
daily breaking in upon me

Nothing absurd appears to them
incredible

Obliged to pay attention to every
foolish thing uttered

Obtain their wishes, without permitting
or promising anything

One of those affronts which women
scarcely ever forgive

Only prayer consisted in the single
interjection "Oh!"

Painful to an honest man to resist
desires already formed

Passed my days in languishing in
silence for those I most admire

Piety was too sincere to give way to
any affectation of it

Placing unbounded confidence in myself
and others

Prescriptions serve to flatter the
hopes of the patient

Priests ought never to have children--
except by married women

Proportioned rather to her ideas than
abilities

Protestants, in general, are better
instructed

Rather bashful than modest

Rather appeared to study with than to
instruct me

Read the hearts of others by
endeavoring to conceal our own

Read description of any malady without
thinking it mine

Read without studying

Remorse wakes amid the storms of
adversity

Remorse sleeps in the calm sunshine of
prosperity

Reproach me with so many contradictions

Return of spring seemed to me like
rising from the grave

Rogues know how to save themselves at
the expense of the feeble

Satisfaction of weeping together

Seeking, by fresh offences, a return of
the same chastisement

Sin consisted only in the scandal

Slighting her favors, if within your
reach, a unpardonable crime

Sometimes encourage hopes they never
mean to realize

Substituting cunning to knowledge

Supposed that certain, which I only
knew to be probable

Taught me it was not so terrible to
thieve as I had imagined

That which neither women nor authors
ever pardon

The malediction of knaves is the glory
of an honest man

The conscience of the guilty would
revenge the innocent

There is nothing in this world but time
and misfortune

There is no clapping of hands before
the king

This continued desire to control me in
all my wishes

Though not a fool, I have frequently
passed for one

To make him my apologies for the
offence he had given me

True happiness is indescribable, it is
only to be felt

Trusting too implicitly to their own
innocence

Tyranny of persons who called
themselves my friends

Virtuous minds, which vice never
attacks openly

Voltaire was formed never to be (happy)

We learned to dissemble, to rebel, to
lie

What facility everything which favors
the malignity of man

When once we make a secret of anything
to the person we love

When everyone is busy, you may continue
silent

Whence comes it that even a child can
intimidate a man

Where merit consists in belief, and not
in virtue

Whole universe would be interested in
my concerns

Whose discourses began by a
distribution of millions

Wish thus to be revenged of me for
their humiliation

Without the least scruple, freely
disposing of my time

Writing for bread would soon have
extinguished my genius

Yielded him the victory, or rather
declined the contest

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
