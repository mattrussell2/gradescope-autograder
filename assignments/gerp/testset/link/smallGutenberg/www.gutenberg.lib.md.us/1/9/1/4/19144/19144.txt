D'ESPOIR.


THE GOVERNOR TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

  Government House,
    St. John's,
      8th July, 1908.

MY LORD,

I have the honour to inform you that I left St. John's on the 28th May
to visit the settlement of the Micmac Indians at Bay d'Espoir, on the
south coast of this Island.

Bay d'Espoir is a long inlet of the sea, extending up country over a
score of miles. The district is hilly, and is covered by a forest of
rather small trees, spruce and birch, but further inland the hills are
generally bare. There are comparatively few European residents in this
bay.

2. The Micmac settlement is on a reservation situated on the eastern
side of the Conne arm of the bay, with a frontage to the water of 230
chains, with an average depth of about 30 chains. It is on the slope
of a wooded hill which is generally steep down to the sea, and at most
places hard and rocky, covered by spruce forest. Most of the Micmac
houses are on an area of about a quarter of a mile, where the ground
is least steep and most suitable for building and gardening. In
Appendix I. hereto is given a list of the 23 families, consisting of
131 persons, now living on or near the Reservation; and of the 7
persons that have left it for Glenwood in this Colony. Two years ago
three families left the Reservation to settle at Lewisport, and have
not returned.

3. The Reservation, it appears, was laid off for the Micmacs about
1872, by Mr. Murray, Geological Surveyor of the Colony. It contained
24 blocks of about 30 acres each, with a water frontage of 10 chains.
From the copy of the plan of the Reservation enclosed herewith it will
be noticed that each parcel was to form the subject of a personal
grant to the individual whose name is on the allotment. The right then
conferred was in each case a "licence to occupy," of which I enclose
a copy in blank form. The licence, it will be observed, would, on the
fulfilment of certain conditions, have been replaced by a grant in
fee, after five years. In few cases, if in any, have the terms of the
licence been complied with, and no grant in fee or other title has
been issued to any of the occupants on this Reservation.

4. These Micmacs are hunters and trappers, and are ignorant alike of
agriculture, of seamanship, and of fishing. There are not more than
three or four acres of cultivated land in the whole settlement. The
greatest cultivator would not grow in one year more than three or four
barrels of potatoes and a few heads of cabbage. There are two
miserable cows in the place, and some of the least poor Micmacs
possess three or four extremely wretched sheep. They have practically
no fowls, but I saw one fowl and a tame wild goose. Their houses are
small and inferior, of sawn timber, but have windows of glass. A few
hundred yards of road, constructed at the expense of the Government,
traverses the end of the settlement where most of the people reside.

5. The community is Roman Catholic, and they have a small church,
decently well built and kept, on the best site on the Reservation. It
is built of sawn timber and would contain nearly one hundred people,
which is too small for the festival of St. Anne, the patroness of the
congregation. Over the entrance to the church there is printed in
large characters, in the Micmac language, a total prohibition against
spitting in church.

The cemetery immediately adjoins the church, and there they bury their
dead as members of a single family.

They have had a small school open since the 17th January last. It is a
wooden room, about 12 feet by 15 feet, by no means new, with a small
stove and two little windows.

The teacher is a woman of partly Micmac origin. She receives some very
small allowance from the parish priest, and a few of the children, she
says, pay some small fees. There are 34 children on the roll, and the
winter attendance was from 25 to 30. They are divided into three
classes, the highest of which could read slowly, in English, words of
three or four letters. About half of them could write a little, a few
of them surprisingly well on such brief tuition. The teacher says they
are very amenable to discipline. Seldom has a school been started
under greater difficulties than this Micmac institution. I was able
sincerely to congratulate the teacher on what she has been able to
accomplish under such unfavourable circumstances. It is manifest that
the children are bright and clever, and that they would become useful
and intelligent citizens if they had ordinary educational advantages.
In this probably lies the best hope of a future prospect for this
community. The settlement is visited now once a month by the parish
priest; and in his absence, one of themselves, Stephen Jeddore, reads
the service on Sunday. Last year they were visited by the Right
Reverend Bishop McNeil.

6. They appear to be a comparatively healthy people. So far as known,
no one is at present affected by tuberculosis in any form. I saw one
woman of ninety years of age, Sarah Aseleka, perhaps the only Micmac
of pure blood in the settlement. She was born at Bay St. George, and
came to Bay d'Espoir some three score of years ago when the Micmacs
first settled in this bay. The next oldest person is John Bernard, who
is about eighty. Few of them were even fairly well clothed; the
majority were in rags. A few wore home-made deer-skin boots, but most
of them had purchased ready-made boots or shoes. They make deer-skin
boots by scraping caribou skin, and tanning it in a decoction of
spruce bark. Such boots are, they state, worn through in a few days.
The women can spin wool, and knit stockings. Their food consists
chiefly of flour, a few potatoes, some cabbage, and perhaps about half
a score of caribou a year for each family, hung up on trees and thus
frozen during the winter. They also smoke fish, principally freshwater
fish, and obtain a few grouse and hares, but this small game has
almost disappeared from the district. They have to go inland a score
of miles to obtain caribou for food.

The men are of good size, and strongly built, but clearly of mixed
descent, many being nearly like Europeans. The children have all,
without exception, very dark, soft eyes, straight black hair, and the
nose much more prominent than in the Esquimaux of Labrador.

7. The principal Chief is Olibia, but I unfortunately did not meet
him. He had gone out in March to his trapping ground near Mount
Sylvester, but could not then reach his traps on account of the
unusually great quantity of snow, and he had returned thither at the
time of my visit.

I was informed that he was selected as Chief by the Micmacs of the
Reservation, and was appointed by the principal Micmac Chief at St.
Anne's, Nova Scotia, and by the priest. I was shown the insignia of
office worn on ceremonial occasions by the Chief. It consists of a
gold medallion with a chain attached, the whole in a case covered by
red velvet. The medallion is inscribed "Presented to the Chief of the
Micmacs Indians of Newfoundland," but with neither name nor date. The
community paid for this badge of office forty-eight dollars.

The second chief is Geodol--called in English Noel Jeddore--who
represented Olibia in his absence. Geodol is the owner of one of the
two cows on the Reservation, and his brother possesses the second one.
The Chieftainship is not hereditary, but is conferred, when a vacancy
occurs, on the man the people prefer. They are easy to govern and
seldom quarrel. They have no intoxicating liquor and seldom obtain
any. They pay 60 to 70 cents a pound for their tobacco, 20 to 30
cents for gunpowder, and 10 cents for shot. They sell their fur
locally where they make their small family purchases.

8. The head of each family has his own special trapping ground in the
interior, over which others may travel, fish, or shoot, but not trap.
For example Geodol, the second chief, traps about Gulp Lake; Olibia,
the chief, about Mount Sylvester; Nicholas Jeddore about Burnt Hill;
George Jeddore at Bare Hill and Middle Ridge; Stephen Jeddore at
Scaffold Hill; Noel Matthews at Great Burnt Lake; &c.

None go as far north as the railway, but Meiklejohn goes as far as
John's Pond. Europeans are encroaching on their trapping lands, but do
not go far inland. This pushes the Micmacs further inland to get away
from the Europeans. They claim no fishing rights at sea, and say
frankly they are only trappers and guides.

They go inland in September, when their first care is to shoot a deer
and smoke the flesh as food. They return home from the 20th to the
25th November to prepare their traps for fox, lynx, otter, and bear.
In December they shoot, as winter food for the family, does and young
stags, but not old stags. They say the arctic hare is now very rare on
their trapping lands; and snipe, geese, and ducks are far fewer than
they were a few years ago. They appear to be very careful not to waste
venison, never killing any deer they do not actually require and use
as food.

9. It is not possible to regard the present condition and the
prospects of this settlement of Micmacs as being bright. Game, their
principal food, is manifestly becoming more difficult to procure;
their trapping lands are being encroached upon by Europeans; they are
not seamen; they are not fishermen; and they do not understand
agriculture. In the middle of their Reservation a saw-mill has been in
operation some years, apparently on the allotment of Bernard John, but
without his sanction or permission, and, it seems, in spite of the
protests of the community. None of the Micmacs work at this mill.
Formerly they cut logs for it, but the trees that grew near the water
have, they say, all been used up and there are none left within their
reach that they could bring to the water. The saw-mill is thus an
eyesore to them, as it is on what they regard as their land, and in
defiance of them.

Although they have not complied with the conditions set forth on the
form of licence, which would have entitled them to a grant in fee, yet
their occupation has extended over so many years that there is no
probability whatever that the Government of Newfoundland would
withhold from them grants, as a matter of grace, if they only applied
for them and could show how they could use the land. It would not be
difficult to find a location for the community that would be more
suitable for them so far as cultivation is concerned, and be equally
good for hunting and trapping. With some aid, such as supplies of
seed potatoes and a few animals, they could no doubt derive much
greater resources than at present from agriculture, especially if to
that were added a good school for the young.

The question of their trapping lands will have to be dealt with before
long. Each man regards his rights to his trapping area as
unimpeachable. They are recognised at present among themselves, but
they have no official sanction for their trapping lands either as a
community or as individuals, just as they have no official title to
the Reservation.

I was accompanied on this visit by the Honourable Eli Dawe, Minister
of Marine and Fisheries, who, as a member of the Government, will
himself take an interest in the settlement, and call the attention of
his colleagues to the condition of the Micmacs. I was also assisted by
Mr. James Howley, who has been on friendly terms with these people for
many years. I enclose photographs[A] of some of the Micmacs, taken by
Mr. Howley during this visit.

10. The Micmacs are held by ethnologists to be a branch of the
Algonquins, who inhabited Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It
was from the last-named province that they extended to Newfoundland,
apparently not much more than a century ago. The fact that they did
not effect a lodgment on Newfoundland sooner may be at least partly
accounted for by supposing that the Beothuks, the aboriginal natives
of Newfoundland, were able to defend themselves and their country from
the Micmacs so long as both sides were unprovided with firearms, and
until the Beothuks were nearly destroyed by their French and English
aggressors.

A sufficiently accurate view of the arrival and early doings of the
Micmacs in Newfoundland may be had from the brief extracts from
official records enclosed herewith. Governor Duckworth reports in 1809
that the Micmacs were coming over, and that the Beothuks were keeping
to the interior in dread of them. The Governor followed up this Report
next year (1810) by a Proclamation to the Micmacs and other American
Indians frequenting Newfoundland, warning them that any person that
murdered a native Indian (Beothuk) would be punished with death.
Unfortunately this Proclamation it would appear had no restraining
effect, as Governor Keats reports to the Secretary of State in 1815
that the Micmacs had recently come over from Nova Scotia in greater
numbers, and had reached the eastern coast of Newfoundland; and he
expressed the fear that these newcomers would destroy the native
Indians of the Island, whose arms were the bow and arrow.

The Micmacs, it appears, have always possessed firearms since they
arrived in Newfoundland. On the other hand I have never heard of a
single instance in which the native Beothuks ever obtained such a
weapon. The fears of Governor Keats were therefore only too well
founded. The unfortunate Beothuk was thus crushed out of existence by
the white man and the invading Micmac. Between the white man and the
Beothuk there was always hostility; and I have not heard of any family
or person in Newfoundland in whose veins flows Beothuk blood. On the
other hand it may be doubted whether there is a single pure-blooded
Micmac on the Island to-day. As an ethnic unit the Micmac can
therefore hardly be said to exist here.

At the same time the Micmac community, such as it is, will not, at
least for several generations, be absorbed into the European
population of Newfoundland. It is at present a separate entity, and as
such clearly requires special attention and treatment at the hands of
the Administration, for the Reservation families have claims on
Newfoundland by right of a century of Micmac occupation, and by virtue
of the European blood that probably each one of them has inherited.

  I have, &c.,

THE GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS TO THE MICMACS, &C.

His Excellency, Sir John Thomas Duckworth, K.B., Vice-Admiral of the
Red, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Island of
Newfoundland, &c.

To the Micmacs, the Esquimaux, and other American Indians frequenting
the said Island, Greeting:

WHEREAS it is the gracious pleasure of His Majesty the King, my
master, that all kindness should be shewn to you in his Island of
Newfoundland, and that all persons of all nations at friendship with
him should be considered in this respect as his own subjects, and
equally claiming his protection while they are within his Dominions:
This is to greet you in His Majesty's name and to entreat you to live
in harmony with each other, and to consider all his subjects and all
persons inhabiting in his Dominions as your brothers, always ready to
do you service, to redress your grievances, and to relieve you in your
distress. In the same light also are you to consider the native
Indians of this Island; they too are, equally with ourselves, under
the protection of our King, and therefore equally entitled to your
friendship. You are entreated to behave to them on all occasions as
you would do to ourselves. You know that we are your friends, and as
they too are our friends, we beg you to be at peace with each other.
And withal, you are hereby warned that the safety of these Indians is
so precious to His Majesty, who is always the support of the feeble,
that if one of ourselves were to do them wrong he would be punished as
certainly and as severely as if the injury had been done to the
greatest among his own people, and he who dared to murder any one of
them would be severely punished with death; your own safety is in the
same manner provided for; see therefore that you do no injury to them.
If an Englishman were known to murder the poorest and the meanest of
your Indians, his death would be the punishment of his crime. Do you
not therefore deprive any one of our friends, the native Indians, of
his life, or it will be answered with the life of him who has been
guilty of murder.

_Extract from Despatch from Governor Sir R.G. Keats to the Secretary
of State, 10th November, 1815._

Some years ago the Micmac Indians formed a settlement in St. George's
Bay on the West Coast of Newfoundland, which is thriving and
industrious. The success of this settlement has probably induced
others to follow them, and latterly they have come over in more
considerable numbers, penetrated into the country and shewn themselves
the present season on the eastern coast of Newfoundland. It is to be
feared the arrival of these new comers will prove fatal to the native
Indians of the Island, whose arms are the bow, with whom their tribe
as well as the Esquimaux are at war, and whose number it is believed
has for some years past not exceeded a few hundred.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
