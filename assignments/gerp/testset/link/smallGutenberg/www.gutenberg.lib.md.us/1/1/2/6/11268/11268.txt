PUBLISHERS' NOTICE.


In the advertisement prefixed to the series of volumes already
published, under the title of the "GOOD CHILD'S LIBRARY," the publishers
gave notice of their intention to issue another series, similar in
character and design, to be devoted to subjects from the Old Testament,
as the other had been to the New. In fulfilment of this notice they have
issued the present series, embellished like the Good Child's Library,
with an entire new set of Illustrations, executed in Oil Colors, in the
best manner. The additional attraction given thereby will, they trust,
obtain for it the same favor as has already been bestowed upon the
former series.

The volumes composing the SCENES AND NARRATIVES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT,
are separate and distinct from each other, having no other connection
than similarity of form and style. The following are the titles of the
different works.

THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
THE FLOOD,
DISPERSION OF MANKIND,
DEPARTURE OF THE ISRAELITES,
HISTORY OF ABRAHAM,
HISTORY OF ISAAC,
HISTORY OF JACOB,
HISTORY OF JOSEPH,
HISTORY OF MOSES,
HISTORY OF JOSHUA,
HISTORY OF SAMUEL,
HISTORY OF DAVID.

The above series in connection with the volumes of the "Good Child's
Library," constitute a choice and attractive Scriptural Library for
Children.

THE FLOOD.




I.

THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN.


    Behold how kind and merciful
      Our heavenly Father was,
    To bear so long with sinful men,
      Who had transgressed His laws.

    The hearts of men wax'd worse and worse,
      They disobeyed the Lord;
    They followed their own thoughts, nor walked
      According to His word.

    And men were multiplied on earth,
      They spread both far and wide;
    And there were giants in those days,
      Who did God's law deride.

    The Lord look'd down from Heaven to see
      If there were any good;
    Behold they all were turn'd aside,
      Sin tainted all their blood.

    Yet still the Lord was good to them--
      He gave them sun and rain,
    And every blessing, yet their hearts
      Were foolish, wicked, vain.

    There is no sin so base as that
      We call ingratitude,
    To use those ill, with wicked hearts,
      Who seek to do us good.

    And when the Great and Holy One
      With kindness stoop'd to bless
    The sorrows of a sinful world,
      And pity their distress;--

    'Twas vile ingratitude in them
      To act so wickedly,
    And spurn the mercy of the Lord,
      The great, the good, the high.

    God's goodness leads us to repent,
      And give our folly o'er;--
    And if we use His kindness right,
      We'll go and sin no more.




II.

GOD IS PROVOKED.


    But God is just as well as good,
      He will not always strive;
    He will assert His sovereign right,
      Nor let the sinner live.

    He does not seek the death of one
      Of all the sinful race,
    Yet He will not forever bear
      With those who slight His grace.

    His mercy is forever sure,
      His justice too must stand,
    And people must obedient be
      To what He does command.

    So when the world so wicked proved,
      And wander'd from the Lord,
    And with most stubborn hearts refused
      To hear His sovereign word;--

    He bore with patience long and kind,
      Their steady wickedness;
    But did at last withdraw His grace,
      And leave them in distress.

    He gave them up to their own hearts,
      To work their own desire;
    He threatened them with judgment vast,
      And kindled was His ire.

    "My spirit shall not always strive"--
      Jehovah sternly said--
    A Flood I'll bring which will destroy
      All things that I have made.

    "Why should they live in guilt and wo,
      And all my words despise;
    Their every work, and every thought,
      Is loathsome to my eyes."

    When God provoked, in anger speaks,
      Who can His word withstand?
    His heart is full of holiness,
      And strong is His right hand.




III.

NOAH AND HIS FAMILY.


    One righteous man was found on earth,
      And him Jehovah loved;
    His thoughts, his words, and all his deeds,
      Were by the Lord approved.

    He kept himself away from sin,
      Nor walk'd with wicked men;
    He loved the God who reigns on high,
      Nor did he love in vain.

    His family he train'd to know,
      And love and serve the Lord;
    And they were safe in keeping all
      The great Jehovah's word.

    The Lord remembered Noah's walk,
      And did not him condemn,
    When, for the wickedness of men,
      He did aloud proclaim,--

    That He would rain upon the earth
      An overwhelming flood;
    But choose him and his family--
      And firm His counsel stood.

    The Lord forever shows regard
      To those who love His ways,
    They vindicate His righteousness
      And ever show His praise.

    So He would not destroy this man
      Who walk'd with Him in love,
    But promised him that He would give
      Protection from above.

    Then Noah's fervent heart was fill'd
      With grief for sinful men;
    Yet though God's judgment was severe,
      He could not once complain.

    He pitied the sad state of those
      Who had despised the Lord;
    He saw that God would punish them,
      According to His word.




IV.

NOAH COMMANDED TO MAKE AN ARK.


    Jehovah unto Noah said:--
      "I will destroy the earth,
    For violence is in the land,
      And wickedness and mirth.

    "Men's hearts are full of laughter wild,
      Their lives are full of sin;
    And I will send destruction swift,
      And show my power divine.

    "I'll rain upon the earth a flood,
      And drown men in the storm,
    And they shall find no arm to save,
      Amid their fearful gloom.

    "But thee I have found true and good,
      A follower of my ways;
    And I will save thee from the flood,
      And lengthen out thy days.

    "Now therefore build thyself an ark,
      According to my word;
    To save thyself and family,
      For ye have fear'd the Lord.

    "For every thing that now has life,
      And all things that have breath,
    Even for the wickedness of man,
      I do devote to death.

    "I am the Lord, the mighty one,
      I, even I, do speak;
    The flood upon the earth I'll bring,
      And nought my word shall break."

    Noah prepared to build the ark,
     The tidings did him grieve;
    Yet it was just, and every word
      He did at once believe.




V.

NOAH PREACHES.


    While Noah built for six score years
      The ark to ride the flood,
    He preach'd unto the people round
      The dreadful word of God.

    He show'd to them their heinous sins,
      He told them God was just,
    That He would surely punish them
      Unto the uttermost.

    Not only did they break God's law
      But they despised His grace;
    That they had most ungrateful proved,
      A hard, rebellious race.

    And though the Lord had suffer'd long,
      Nor seem'd to notice them,
    Yet soon He would arise in might,
      And loud His wrath proclaim.

    He told them of the impending flood,
      The threatening of the Lord;
    And that His counsel sure would stand,
      And ever true His word.

    But if they would repent, perhaps
      The Lord would turn away
    His anger from the earth and thus
      Avert the dreadful day.

    But if they should persist in sin
      And folly to the last;
    Then God in wrath would visit them,--
      Their day of grace be past.

    He there fore bade them all repent,
      And turn from all their sin,
    And humbly to Jehovah pray,
      To stay His wrath divine.

    The time wore on, the ark progress'd,
      And Noah grew more bold;
    And to the people day by day,
      God's threatened judgment told.

    They heeded not his solemn words,
      Nor mark'd his tearful eye;
    But still continued in their sin
      Against the Lord most high.

    They mock'd him with their taunting speech,
      And call'd him foolish, vain,
    To think that God would drown the earth
      And men in floods of rain.

    They look'd up to the heavens above,
      No threatening clouds were there;
    They laugh'd, they sang, they danced in pride,
      Nor thought of God, or prayer.

    All things remained the same to them,
      For nearly six score years;
    Why should they have distress of mind,
      Or yield their soul to fears?

    Still, Noah, faithful to his trust,
      His solemn warnings gave;
    And patiently prepared the ark,
      His family to save

    And still the people wagg'd their heads,
      As they were passing by,
    And look'd first on his monster ark,
      Then upward to the sky;--

    Then smiled in scorn, and went their way,
      To sin and folly prone;
    Not dreaming, though the skies look'd fair,
      They'd soon be left alone.

    Amid the angry storms of Heaven,
      And rising waves around
    Overflowing all the fields of earth,
      And all the highest ground.




VI.

NOAH ENTERS THE ARK.


    And now the ark was built; the day
      Of wrath was drawing near;
    Yet still no cloud was in the sky;
      And in men's hearts no fear.

    No doubt they wonder'd much what now
      This foolish man would do;
    And thought that they would surely prove,
      His prophecy untrue.

    But soon he heard Jehovah's voice;--
      These words he heard Him say,--
    "Come thou into the ark at once,
      With all thy family."

    So Noah enter'd in the ark,
      He and his children too,
    And beasts and birds of every kind,
      Did enter two by two.

    The lives of these Jehovah spared,
      To fill the earth again,
    When He should cause the ark to rest,
      And should the flood restrain.

    And when they all were in the ark,
      The just and mighty God,
    Prepared to bring upon the earth
      The waters of the flood.

    The day of grace was fully past,
      No voice should now proclaim,
    To sinful, faithless, scoffing men,
      Jehovah's gracious name.

    The righteous in God's care were safe,
      From every fear of harm;
    But wicked men would be o'erwhelm'd
      With terrible alarm.

VII.

THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN ARE OPENED.


    Ah! where shall now the sinner hide--
      what power the storm can stay?
    What pleasing charm can he call up
      To drive his fears away?

    Who can withstand the wrath of God!
      He with a single breath,
    Could vanquish all our boasted strength,
      And visit us with death.

    He gathers now His angry clouds,
      And thick they quickly come;
    Bearing along the teeming rains
      And the devouring storm.

    The beauteous sky is overcast.
      And darkness fills the air;
    And lightnings flash, and thunders roll;
      No ray of hope is there.

    As if the clouds are not enough,
      Heaven's windows open wide,
    To pour upon the startled earth
      The overflowing tide.

    The clouds come down almost to earth,
      And seem to bend with rain;
    And men look up with fearful gaze,
      Nor can their fear restrain.

    Oh! fearful and majestic scene;
      Jehovah's awful frown
    Seems o'er the sinfulness of earth,
      In anger bending down.

    No sun now cheers, no light of star
      To those shall ever come,
    Who by their long continued crimes,
      Provoked this awful doom.




VIII.

THE FOUNTAINS OF THE DEEP ARE BROKEN UP.


    Not only did the clouds come up,--
      Heaven's windows open wide;--
    The fountains of the deep were stirr'd,
      And raged on every side.

    The clouds pour'd down their treasures vast,
      The deeps yield up their store,
    The proudest trembles at the form
      Of God's almighty power.

    The seas are swelling up in wrath,
      And break the appointed bound--
    Their waters overflow the shore
      And fiercely rage around.

    The rivers rise to fearful height,
      And roll their torrents on,
    Until their highest banks are lost
      From sight, deep overflown.

    The fountains too and hidden springs,
      Seem bursting everywhere;
    Their waters flow on every side,
      The common rage to share.

    Now wave meets wave, and swells the flood
      In fury o'er the land,
    Fulfilling all the will of God,
      Obeying His command.

    O God! the power is thine alone,
      To punish and create;
    We would with reverence bow to Thee,
      And worship might so great

    And may we never dare provoke
      That high Almighty Power,
    Which once awaked against our sins,
      Could blast us in an hour.




IX.

THE FLOATING ARK.


    The waters lifted up the ark,
      Majestic it did ride
    Above the swelling, surging waves,
      Along the rolling tide.

    The freight of life it bore along,
      Secure from every harm;
    And though the tempest raged without,
      Their hearts knew no alarm.

    To God in humble earnest prayer,
      They sent their feeble cry,
    And He with power and love did look,
      Down from His throne on high.

    And while the raging waves did roar,
      And swift destruction bring,
    Jehovah sheltered them beneath
      The shadow of His wing.

    The ark Jehovah guided through
      The vast unmeasured deep;
    And all the life therein reposed
      He did in safety keep.

    It floated o'er the valleys low,
      And o'er the highest hill,
    For high the waters rose, and thus
      Obey'd the Almighty Will.

    How strong that hand that can protect,
      When danger rages round;
    The mercy of our Father God,
      Doth every where abound.

    And those who put their trust in Him,
      And to Him ever pray,
    Will find it is the safest thing
      His counsel to obey.




X.

THE DROWNING WORLD.


    Now let us for awhile return
      And see the startled world,
    With all its pride and all its sin
      Swift into ruin hurl'd.

    The waters now are rising fast,
      And men are in despair;
    They can themselves no succur find,
      No ear now hears their prayer.

    They once derided him who preached
      To them the coming wo,
    But now no voice cries out, Repent;
      Ah! whither shall they go?

    The ark to them is firmly closed,
      They cannot enter in;
    They see the flood is rising round;
      They perish in their sin.

    Not highest trees can shelter them,
      Nor mountain caverns hide,
    For caves and heights are fill'd and lost,
      As onward sweeps the tide.

    Ah! would that they had heard the word
      That faithful Noah preach'd;
    Accepted of Jehovah's grace
      Which he to them out-reach'd.

    But now, alas! it is too late;
      No human power can save
    A single soul from perishing,
      Beneath the flooding wave.

    Oh! let us not provoke our God;
      But of His grace partake;
    And feel our sins are blotted out
      For His own mercy's sake.




XI.

THE ARK RESTS ON ARARAT.


    For forty days and forty nights,
      The waters of the flood
    Prevail'd o'er all the face of earth,
      Obedient to the word.

    Which God the great Jehovah spake,
      To drown it for its sin;
    His word is holy, just and right
      Forever sure, divine.

    The earth was drown'd; all living things
      Had perish'd from its face,
    Save Noah and his family,
      Protected by God's grace.

    The ark rode onward with the flood;
      The hand of God did guide
    The vessel with its freight of life,
      O'er all the swelling tide.

    The clouds do now withdraw aside;
      The deepest fountains cease,
    To pour their treasures forth on earth;
      The waters slow decrease.

    The ark moves on to Ararat,
      And rests upon its height;
    While Noah and his family,
      Are fill'd with great delight.

    They long to see the earth again,
      Cleansed by Jehovah's hand;
    They long to see the sun, great orb,
      Shine brightly o'er the land.

    They long to see the trees put forth,
      And beauteous flowers spring,--
    The fields with verdure clothed, and hear
      The birds of morning sing.




XII.

NOAH SENDS FORTH THE RAVEN AND THE DOVE.


    Then Noah sent a raven forth,
      Out of a window high,
    To wander here and there, until
      the waters should be dry.

    And then again he sent a dove
      That he might something learn,
    But she could find no resting-place,
      And did to him return.

    The waters still spread o'er the earth,
      And slowly did abate;
    For seven days more within the ark,
      He patiently did wait.

[Illustration: The River Nile by Moonlight.]

    And then he sent her forth again,
      And back she came at eve,
    And bearing in her mouth she brought
      To him an olive-leaf.

    This token told him that the flood
      Was drying fast away;
    But Noah still within the ark
      For seven days more did stay.

    He now the third time sent the dove,
      Nor did he send in vain,
    The waters of the flood were dry;--
      She ne'er returned again.

    She found a resting-place on earth,
      Beneath a sunny sky,
    And with a gladsome, joyous heart,
      She round about did fly.

    Then Noah look'd forth from the ark,
      And lifted up to God,
    His thankfulness for keeping him,
      According to His word.




XIII.

NOAH COMES FORTH FROM THE ARK.


    And now the Lord to Noah spake,
      And bade him from the ark
    Go forth, and stand upon the earth,
      And all his family take.

    The waters from the earth had fled,
      The ground was clean and dry,
    No threatening billows form'd around,
      No clouds were in the sky.

    So Noah left the ark, and came
      Forth to the open air,
    And all the beasts and creeping things,
      And fowls, were with him there.

    He brought them out to fill the earth.
      To multiply and live;
    That they might magnify His name,
      Who every good doth give.

    Behold the wondrous hand of God,
      How matchless is His skill,
    Who works in heaven and on the earth,
      The counsel of His will.

    How great, how awful, and how just
      Was that Almighty word,
    Which, for the sinfulness of men,
      Did call the dreadful flood.

    And while the world was perishing,
      'Tis pleasing to observe,
    The loving-kindness of the Lord,
      Who did the good preserve.

    He saved them in the ark, while fell
      The overflowing rain;
    And when the flood was dried away,
      He brought them forth again.




XIV.

NOAH SACRIFICES TO THE LORD.


    When Noah came forth from the ark,
      His heart was filled with praise;
    He worshipp'd God with thankful voice,
      For His abounding grace.

    He rear'd to God an altar there,
      And offer'd sacrifice,
    And kneeling with his family,
      To heaven did lift his eyes.

    And God was pleased with Noah's praise,
      And witnessed from above
    The offering which in faith he made,
      And blest him with His love.

    Jehovah said--"I will no more,
      Destroy or curse the ground,
    But will display my love and grace,
      Wherever life is found."

    How tender, loving is the Lord,
      Whose anger does not burn
    Forever 'gainst the sons of men,
      But calls them to return.

    He says to men--"Repent and live,
      And all my law obey,
    And I your strength and hope shall be,
      Through all life's devious way."

    O! sacrifice to God in faith,
      And all your sins confess,
    And with the riches of His love,
      He will your spirits bless.

    For blood of bulls, or lambs or goats,
      Jehovah does not care,
    But bring the offering of your hearts,
      With humble earnest prayer.




XV.

THE BOW IN THE CLOUDS.


    Jehovah now a covenant made,
      That He would bring no more
    A flood of water o'er the earth,
      As He had done before.

    The nations now should prove His love,
      His truth and power divine;
    His attributes o'er all the earth,
      With glory bright do shine.

    His mercy hath no bound but truth,
      And all His works do prove,
    Unto the sons of men abroad,
      His constant, perfect love.

    He set the beauteous Bow on high
      With many colours bright,
    To show His covenant with men,
      Was faithful, gracious, right.

    It hung in heaven, upheld by God,
      And arch'd the distant gloom,
    And bent on either side to earth,
      In bright and graceful form.

    This covenant Jehovah keeps,
      Forever faithful, true;
    For when the rains are o'er, then high
      The rainbow comes in view.

    Whene'er we gaze upon its form,
      And note its colours fair;
    Our hearts should be inspired toward God,
      With love and praise and prayer.

    He gives the sun to warm the earth;
      He sends the healthful shower,
    And saves us always, through His grace,
      By His almighty power.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
