The Prelude

--A Note Explanatory--



  With James Whitcomb Riley,
  some years ago. This Man From Down On The Farm,
  made a Reading Tour, of--in Population--more than
  one-half of this Imperial Republic, including
  the Cream of the Canadian Provinces.
  Of that Tour, at some other time, in some more
  leisurely hour, he desires, if able, to make
  a full and faithful Record.
  This, is but a humble Spray of Kentucky Pine,
  placed at the feet of the Dead Poet!

  According to a long established Custom,
    the Man, in some way, in private print--
  --for the Relative, for the Friend, for the Stranger too--
  quietly Celebrates the various Red-Letter Days, of the
  Dear Lady Here, On the Banks of Wolf Run--his Mother!
  Her full Restoration, to her usual Good Health,
  is a Source of much Joy, and the cause of much Gratitude.
  The many Prayers made for her Recovery must have been of
  much avail before the Great White Throne, of Infinite Mercy!
  He is also deeply grateful, that the nearness of her
  Eighty-Fifth Birthday, makes it possible for him,
  to make an Inscription Two-fold, for the Dead,
  for the Living--for the Dear Poet, for the Beloved Mother!
  The linking of their names together, under this Spray of
  Kentucky Pine--culled by a hand most loving--is like
  unto finding the other half of a broken Chord, in some
  Prelude Elusive: for James Whitcomb Riley, deeply
  endeared himself, to the Dear Lady Here, while he and
  her son were a long while away, on their Reading Tour.
  Out of sheer Kindliness, out of Goodness of Heart, he often
  wrote to her, delightful Letters of Good Cheer, filled with
  a charming detail, with more than a trifle of over-Praise;
  all of which, is most acceptable, to the heart of a too fond mother.
  Recently, from his Winter Home in the South-land, he sent to
  her, in response to one of these Farm Bubbles, a little
  Bit of unpublished Verse, written before his hand had
  failed him, reproduced for her--and others--in _fac-simile_.

  Pray deem it not, all too presumptuous, this humble
  Spray of Kentucky Pine!
  It serves as a Reverent Tribute to the One!
  As a Loving Commemoration to the Other!




The Interlude

--Holding Two Telegrams And A Plea--


I.


  When the word came that
  James Whitcomb Riley was Dead
  this Telegram was sent to a near
  Relative an astute Man of Affairs
  who with the Head of a Great Publishing
  House--a Prime Favorite from
  his early Boyhood of the Poet--held
  his well-placed Confidence in all
  matters concerning the necessary
  material Things of Life.


  The mightiest Monarch of the Indiana Forest
    lies prone upon his Native Soil!
  This Man From Down On The Farm,
  Reverently, sends this humble Spray of Kentucky Pine,
  as a Symbol, ever-green, of his Lasting Love, for the Dead Poet:
  as a Symbol, made manifest, of his deep Sympathy,
  for You, for Yours.


II.


  This Message was wired to a most
  Gentle Lady who had meant
  so much in so many ways to
  James Whitcomb Riley
  appealing as she did to the Best
  to the Highest in his Nature and who
  was indeed a "Ministering Angel"
  when "Pain and Anguish" wrung
  his brow, racked his frail body
  where lingered its Tenant
  his Immortal Soul!


  Tenderly, Lovingly, let the Fair Elaine cherish
    the Shield Invincible of her Sir Launcelot!
  Some Day--Some Glad Day--she too, will go upward
  with the Flood, in the Dark Barge, decked with Flowers:
  clasping in her Beautiful Hand of Gentle Service,
  the Lily of Fidelity: floating with the Mystic
  Tide, to meet again--at Towered Camelot--
  --her Gallant, her Waiting Knight!
  For Love shares with the Soul its Precious Immortality!


III.


The Plea

--To The Relatives To The Intimate Friends of James Whitcomb Riley--


  Let Lockerbie Street, in its Lovely Brevity,
    be held--if you will--as a Perpetual Reservation
  for the Children of your Great, your Growing City,
  holding the House, which for many years was the
  Happy Home of the Poet, as a Sacred Shrine.
  Let your fine Civic Building, now rising in its
  Majesty--like the Towers of Illion--made possible
  by his Generous Gift of the Site, made Glorious
  by the touch of his hand, on its Great Cornerstone:
  let it--if you will--proudly bear his Name.
  Let either one, or both, of these Noble Things
  be done, for the sake of his memory.
  Let this, that, or any other form of a Memorial wait upon
  the wisdom of your Choice: but no matter what is done;
  how much is done; or how it is done; there is one Thing
  which ought not to be left undone.
  Every tender, slender needle, rising out of its
  Globular Greenness, in this humble Spray of Kentucky Pine,
  harbors this One Thought, this Single Plea!
  This is the Plea:

  Let James Whitcomb Riley,
  skillfully cast in Bronze, simply clad in the plain
  blue garb of a Union Soldier Lad a Private--
  let him stand fur all Time, in your Circle, in the Centre,
  in the Heart of your City, the beloved City of his adoption.
  Let him stand there, under the shadow of that
  Mighty Shaft, the Tribute of your Grand Commonwealth,
  to her Valiant Sons--the Soldier, the Sailor.
  Let him stand there, on a one-piece Pedestal
  of Indiana Stone; Simple, Massive.
  Thereon carve his Name, the date of his Birth;
  the date of his Death; and these Immortal words:

      "Well, Goodby, Jim:
              Take Keer of Yourse'f!"

  Read, re-read, and read again, the Poem.
  That Poem is an American Classic!
  It is the Epitome of Self-Sacrifice
  for the Sake of a Vital Cause!
  It is the one Idyl of the Middle-West!
  It is thoroughly America!
  It is intensely Indiana!
  Pardon the Plea!
  But Prepare the Way!
  Turn the Page--read the Poem!




The Poem


  Old man never had much to say--
    'Ceptin' to Jim.--
  And Jim was the wildest boy he had--
    And the old man jes' wrapped up in him!
  Never heerd him speak but once
  Er twice in my life,--and first time was
  When the army broke out, and Jim he went,
  The old man backin' him, fer three months;
  And all 'at I heerd the old man say
  Was jes' as we turned to start away,--
    "Well, good-by, Jim:
      Take keer of yourse'f!"

  'Peared-like, he was more satisfied
    Jes' _lookin'_ at Jim
  And likin' him all to hisse'f-like, see?
    'Cause he was jes' wrapped up in him!
  And over and over I mind the day
  The old man come and stood round in the way
  While we was drillin', a-watchin' Jim--
  And down at the deepot a-heerin' him say,
    "Well, good-by, Jim:
      Take keer of yourse'f!"

  Never was nothin' about the _farm_
    Disting'ished Jim;
  Neighbors all ust to wonder why
    The old man 'peered wrapped up in him;
  But when Cap. Biggler he writ back
  'At Jim was the bravest boy we had
  In the whole dern rigiment, white er black.
  And his fighten' good as his farmin' bad--
  'At he had led, with a bullet clean
  Bored through his thigh, and carried the flag
  Through the bloodiest battle you ever seen,
  The old man wound up a letter to him
  'At Cap. read to us, 'at said: "Tell Jim
    Good-by,
      And take keer of hisse'f!"

  Jim come home jes' long enough
    To take the whim
  'At he'd like to go back in the calvery--
    And the old man jes' wrapped up in him!
  Jim 'lowed 'at he'd had sich luck afore,
  Guessed he'd tackle her three years more.
  And the old man give him a colt he'd raised,
  And follered him over to Camp Ben Wade,
  And laid around fer a week er so,
  Watchin' Jim on dress-parade--
  Tel finally he rid away,
  And last he heerd was the old man say,
    "Well, good-by, Jim:
      Take keer of yourse'f!"

  Tuk the papers, the old man did,
    A-watchin' fer Jim--
  Fully believin' he'd make his mark
    _Some_ way--jes' wrapped up in him!--
  And many a time the word 'u'd come
  'At stirred him up like the tap of a drum--
  At Petersburg, fer instunce, where
  Jim rid right into their cannons there,
  And _tuk_ 'em, and p'inted 'em t'other way,
  And socked it home to the boys in gray,
  As they scooted fer timber, and on and on--
  Jim a lieutenant and one arm gone,
  And the old man's words in his mind all day,--
    "Well, good-by, Jim:
      Take keer of yourse'f!"

  Think of a private now, perhaps,
    We'll say like Jim,
  'At's clumb clean up to the shoulder-straps
    And the old man jes' wrapped up in him!
  Think of him--with the war plum, through.
  And the glorious old Red-White-and-Blue
  A-laughin' the news down over Jim,
  And the old man bendin' over him--
  The surgeon turin' away with tears
  'At hadn't leaked for years and years,
  As the hand of the dyin' boy clung to
  His father's, the old voice in his ears,--
    "Well, good-by, Jim:
      Take keer of yourse'f!"

The Spray of Kentucky Pine


  O! James Whitcomb Riley!
  This Man From Down On The Farm--one-while
  your constant Companion, in work most
  Congenial, all-while your Faithful Friend--rejoices.
  and is exceeding Glad, That All Is Well With You!
  For no one knew, better than you,
  the Wisdom, the Beauty, of Death!
  No one the more fully realized
  the Folly, the Futility, of human Grief!
  You firmly believed, that he, who follows The Christ;
  that he, who, in all Humility, bears the Cross; that
  he, who, in all Gratitude, wears upon his unworthy brow,
  the imprint of the Kiss Divine!--the Kiss of Forgiveness
  Complete--you firmly believed, that he ought to be
  brave enough, strong enough, to meet the Call,
  whensoever, wheresoever, it may chance to come.
  You firmly believed that the Call always
  comes at the Right Moment: that Incompletion
  Here, finds its Completement There: that every
  human Life holds--like the Palace of Aladdin--its
  unfinished Window: that the finite mind,
  hampered by its mortality, is a clog to any
  Completion, to any Earthly Perfection.
  Therefore, feeling, believing, as you did Here,
  now knowing, as you must _know_ There,
  this Man rejoices, and is exceeding Glad,
  That All Is Well With You!

  O! James Whitcomb Riley
  Your Nature-on the surface--was
  Simple, Honest, Open, Direct.
  It was all of that but--it was More!
  It was deeper than Tears!
  It was wider than Laughter!
  It was more profound, more subtle,
  than either your spoken Word.
  or, your written, your printed Thought.
  You were infinitely better than the
  Very Best that you ever did!
  High Praise, but True!
  Your nature was strangely Complex:

    There was the Man!
      There was the Poet!
        There was the Mystic!

  The Man could be known--and was--of all men.
  The Poet could be read--as he was--and he understood.
  He could Sing--as he did--Songs
  which caught the Hearts of the
  People--from the Cradle to the Grave!
  The Mystic!

  O! James Whitcomb Riley!
  That Mystic Element in your Nature!
  It was held under a Strong Curb:
  It was constantly held in Check:
  But it was never Overcome!
  It was a Mood--not a Madness.
  It seldom made an Outward Sign.
  Then, it was brief, spasmodic, eratic.
  It was known to but few, even of those
  who came with you, in constant contact.
  To this Man, that Mystic Element in your Nature,
  made a most wonderful Appeal, deep, strong.
  To him, it was the _real_ James Whitcomb Riley!
  You were a Mystic, but never a Reformer.
  You cheerfully rendered unto Ceasar all things
  that were his just due.
  You had no desire to overturn Natural Law,
  Human Regulation.
  You accepted, without question, the Established
  Order of Things.
  But so strong was this touch of the Mystic
  that, it you had desired, you could have,
  quickly, thickly, populated some far off Smiling Isle,
  of the Fair Summer Seas, with a Band of
  Cultured Men, of Cultured Women, ready,
  eager, to follow you--that Mystic You! into
  the Creation of a New Cult, of a New Religion!
  In your Poems there is but a trickle of the Mystic
  --a flash a dash--as the falling of a Star!
  That Edgar Allen Poe Episode, is the Answer.
  You were unduly humiliated by that Incident--
  --and it was but as Nothing
  But your Super-Sensitiveness, made you Suffer!

  O! James Whitcomb Riley!
  Death, hath yet other Compensations!
  It has placed you Beyond the Cloy of Fulsome Praise:
  Beyond the Sting of Cruel Blame: the One,
  may not help You the Other, cannot hurt You!

  O! James Whitcomb Riley!
  Once, when under the Spell of a Mystic Mood,
  you sought--as you had often sought before--that
  Wise Wizard of White River.
  He met you, when you came into that Peaceful
  Indiana Valley--where dwells this Wizard--by the
  Flowing Fountain of those Healing Waters.
  He knew your need; he spoke no unnecessary word;
  he quickly set his place in order, and was ready
  to go with you--anywhere.
  There had been, on your arrival, a clamor to have
  you Read that afternoon--but the Wizard
  quietly slipped you away.
  Out into the Open you drove, in an old Barouche,
  behind a Pair of Good Horses.
  It was a long Drive; it was a beautiful Drive.
  It was driven in Silence.
  After several hours--the spell was still upon you--a
  sharp turn brought you to the Banks of White River;
  and there--under a Clump of the Sycamore, of the
  Willow, in a deep, Shady Pool, an Eddy, undisturbed
  by the current of the broad, shallow Stream--a
  Batch of Boys, swimming, chattering, diving.
  "Stop" you said to the driver; "Come here" you called to the Lads.
  They came trooping, dripping, out of the Pool.
  A change came over you; flinging off your coat,
  your hat, you arose to your feet.
  There they stood before you, naked, unabashed, curious.
  A complacent smile, flickered across the bearded
  face of the Wise Wizard. He must have known!
  He must have timed your arrival at that particular
  spot, at that particular moment.
  But even the Wizard could not have known what was to follow.
  Without a word of explanation, you gave them, that
  crowd of naked Boys--gave it, as you had never
  given it before, doubtless, as you never
  gave it again--your




"Old Swimmin' Hole"


  Oh! the old swimmin' hole! whare the crick so still and deep
  Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep,
  And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below
  Sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to know
  Before we could remember anything but the eyes
  Of the angels lookin' out as we left Paradise;
  But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle,
  And its hard to part ferever with the old swimmin'-hole.

  Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the happy days of yore,
  When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore.
  Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide
  That gazed back at me so gay and glorified,
  It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress
  My shadder smilin' up at me with sich tenderness.
  But them days is past and gone, and old Time's tuck his toll
  From the old man come back to the old swimmin'-hole.

  Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the long, lazy days
  When the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways.
  How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane,
  Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane
  You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole
  They was lot o' fun on hands at the old swimmin'-hole.
  But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll
  Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin'-hole.

  Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall,
  And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all;
  And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
  Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled;
  And the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered by
  Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky,
  Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's controle
  As it cut acrost some orchurd to'rds the old swimmin'-hole.

  Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I last saw the place,
  The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face;
  The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot
  Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot.
  And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be--
  But never again will theyr shade shelter me!
  And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul.
  And dive off in my grave like the old swimmin'-hole.


  Their little jaws dropped!
    Their little eyes distended!
      Their little ears stood erect!

  They fairly bristled with an intense attention.
  You said the last word, of the last line.
  Then--absolute, unbroken--Silence!
  Finally--but without another word--you reached
  down, patted the youngest one on his wet curly Locks.
  The Wizard whispered to the driver "Go."
  As the team, in a brisk trot, started away.
  you, still standing, coatless, hatless, waved your
  hand--in that quick little jerky fashion peculiar
  to you--to those little naked Urchins.
  With a mighty Shout, they ran back to the Pool,
  and gave a rapid-firing Exhibition of the Single
  Dive; the Double Dive; and one--a dare-devil--the Triple Dive!
  What a Memory, what a Priceless Memory, you must
  have given those Boys of Martinsville, that Ideal
  Summer Afternoon, in the Long While Ago!
  Martinsville! To you of Blessed Memory!
  For the sake of an early, enduring, Friendship,
  did you not encrust one Jap Miller of
  Martinsville with no mean verse?
  And did it not run something like this?


  Jap Miller down at Martinsville's the blamedest feller yit!
  When _he_ starts in a-talkin' other folks is apt to quit!--
  'Pears like that mouth o' his'n wuzn't made fer nothin' else
  But jes' to argify 'em down and gether in their pelts:
  He'll talk you down on tariff; er he'll talk you down on tax.
  And prove the pore man pays 'em all and them's about the fac's!
  Religen, law, er politics, prize-fightin', er base-ball
  Jes' tetch Jap up a little and he'll post you 'bout 'em all.

       *       *       *       *       *

  W'y, that-air blame Jap Miller, with his keen sircastic fun,
  Has got more friends than ary candidate 'at ever run!
  Don't matter what _his_ views is, when he states the same to you,
  They allus coincide with your'n, the same as two and two:
  You _can't_ take issue with him--er, at least, they haint no sense
  In startin' in to down him, so you better not commence.--
  The best way's jes' to listen, like your humble servant does.
  And jes' concede Jap Miller is the best man ever wuz!


  On the drive back to the little Station, you were
  the Man, the Poet, but not the Mystic!
  You delighted the Wizard with your genial
  flow of Verse, of Story.
  When the watchful Wizard, smuggled you aboard
  your train--with privacy unbroken you, like
  King Saul, returned to your People, refreshed in body,
  restored in mind; for had not the Wizard done for you,
  as David did for Saul, for had not he brought Peace
  to your no longer Troubled Soul?
  Did he not say to you, in parting, "All Is Well With You?"

  O! James Whitcomb Riley!
  It is late in the Afternoon, of a Perfect Summer Day.
  This Man From Down On The Farm,
  is standing on the Banks Of Wolf Run.
  He is thinking of You!
  Joyfully, not Regretfully!
  A Pastoral Scene stretches before him--
  a Scene of much Beauty!
  The Cattle stand, not "knee-deep in June"
  but well into the pure rippling Waters of an August
  Wolf Run, under the dense shade overhead, where
  arching branches inter-lock, casting a net-work
  of shifting Shadows on the bosom of the Peaceful
  Waters, which seem to murmer, as they
  flow, your Name--Joyfully, not Mournfully!

        James Whitcomb Riley!
            James Whitcomb Riley!
                James Whitcomb Riley!

  Smiling, undulating, across the Creek,
  a Blue Grass Meadow gently rolls away,
  toward the White, the Winding Pike:
  Each blade of Blue Grass--Joyfully,
  not Tearfully--seems to whisper your Name:

        James Whitcomb Riley!
            James Whitcomb Riley!
                James Whitcomb Riley!

  But Hark! The belated Song of a Mocking Bird--
  its Vesper Song--to its enraptured Mate!
  This, the Glad Song:

  To You James Whitcomb Riley!
  The World was full of Roses!
  Every Rose held hidden, within its Tremulous Heart, a
  Slender Crystal Chalice of Perfumed Dew, which,
  overflowing, spilled its Prodigal Sweetness,
  onto the Earth, into the Air,

  For You James Whitcomb Riley!
  --For You, and for All Humanity!
  And this, the Joyful Refrain:
  --Joy, without Regret!
      Joy, without Mourning!
          Joy, without Tears!--
  --A Refrain which readily, willingly,
  finds Grateful Echo in the Heart of
  This Man From Down On The Farm!

        O! James Whitcomb Riley!
          All Is Well With You!
            All Is Well With You!
              O! James Whitcomb Riley!
                All Is Well With You!
                  O! James Whitcomb Riley!

Postlude

  --Which ought to have been The Prelude to
  this Spray of Kentucky Pine.
  Because it was written, published, a little more than a year
  before the Death of the Poet.
  Therefore, it was a Tribute to him, _Living!_


  A Promethean Poet was there. He had touched the
  Heavenly flame; he had lasted the Waters of
  Inspiration: he had drained the Crystal Cup of Fancy,
  finding therein neither Lees nor Dregs, which
  bite the tongue, stifle the song, of lesser Men; he had
  reverently kissed the coy hand of Fame, when she had
  crowned his Worthy Brow, with her Wreath Immortal!
  His Poems, homely, simple, sweet--springing from the lap of
  Nature--had spread, like wild-fire of the Forest,
  into the Four Quarters of the Globe.
  He came from the Land, across the River, where, in
  these latter days, the People quit the planting of the Potato,
  to pen a Poem: pause in the cultivation of the Corn, to
  compose a Novel. Some of it is good, very good; Some
  of it is bad, very bad: but all of it produces
  a princely Revenue far in excess of any return
  from either the Potato or the Corn.
  Long before the avalanche-like advent of this State-
  wide Literary Madness, the Star of this Poet had risen--
  risen before, and still shines beyond, and above them all.
  The hand which wrote "Goodbye, Jim"--not classical
  in either Greek or Roman sense, yet a great
  American Classic--with its pungent odor of Blue Jeans, with
  its clean, sweet, clear-cut, fine smell, of its native soil--
  that hand may never again hold the Pen; the man
  himself, may crumble--God forbid!--back into the Dust--
  that "Little Dust of Harm"--out of which he came;
  but his Poems will not, cannot die.
  When those other Writers will have been forgotten;
  when even the gifted Maker of "Ben Hur" will be, but
  as an empty name; even then, this Poet,
  and his Poems, will cleave to the Mind, cling to the
  Heart, of countless Generations, not yet born!

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
