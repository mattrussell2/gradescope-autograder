CROWS.


They stream across the fading western sky
    A sable cloud, far o'er the lonely leas;
    Now parting into scattered companies,
Now closing up the broken ranks, still high
And higher yet they mount, while, carelessly,
    Trail slow behind, athwart the moving trees
    A lingering few, 'round whom the evening breeze
Plays with sad whispered murmurs as they fly.

A lonely figure, ghostly in the dim
    And darkening twilight, lingers in the shade
    Of bending willows: "Surely God has laid
His curse on me," he moans, "my strength of limb
    And old heart-courage fail me, and I flee
    Bowed with fell terror at this augury."




FUTURITY.


What of our life when this frail flesh lies low
    A withered clod, and the free soul has burst
    Through the world-fetters? Not of souls accursed
With cherished lusts that mar them, those who sow
Evil and reap the harvest, and who bow
    At Mammon's golden shrine, but those who thirst
    For Truth, and see not,--spirits deep immersed
In doubt and trouble,--hearts that fain would know?

The soul is satisfied. The spirit trained
  For the divine, because the beautiful,
Now with the body gone, free and unstained,
  Doubts swept away like clouds of scattering wool
    Before a blast,--e'er Heaven's pure paths are trod
    Is perfected to understand its God.




THERE IS NO GOD.


There is no God? If one should stand at noon
    Where the glow rests, and the warm sunlight plays,
    Where earth is gladdened by the cordial rays
And blossoms answering, where the calm lagoon
Gives back the brightness of the heart of June,
    And he should say: "There is no sun"--the day's
    Fair shew still round him,--should we lose the blaze
And warmth, and weep that day has gone so soon?

Nay, there would be one word, one only thought,
    "The man is blind!" and throbs of pitying scorn
       Would rouse the heart, and stir the wondering mind.
    We _feel_, and _see_, and therefore _know_,--the morn
  With blush of youth ne'er left us till it brought
       Promise of full-grown day. "The man is blind!"




DISAPPOINTMENT.


The light has left the hill-side. Yesterday
    These skies shewed blue against the dusky trees,
    The leaves' soft murmur in the evening breeze
Was music, and the waves danced in the bay.
Then was my heart, as ever, far away
    With you,--and I could see you as one sees
    A mirrored face,--and happiness and ease
And hope were mine, in spite of long delay.

After these months of waiting, this is all!
    Hope, dead, lies coffined, shrouded in despair,
    With all the blessings of the outer air
Forgot, 'neath the black covering of a pall.
    Only the darkening of the woodland ways,
    A heart's low moaning over wasted days.




A SHADOW.


The world to-day is radiant, as I ne'er
    Could picture it in wildest dreaming, when
    For long, long hours I lay in flowery glen
Or wooded copse, and tried in vain to tear
The glamour from my eyes, and face the glare
    And tumult of the busy world of men.
    I staked my all, and won! and ne'er again
Can my blest spirit know a heart's despair.

And yet--and yet--why should it be that now,
    When all my heart has longed for is at last
      Within my grasp, and I should be at rest,
A ghostly Something rising in the glow
      Of Love's own fire, an uninvited guest,
    Taunts me with just one memory of the past!




TRIUMPH.


The sky, grown dull through many waiting days,
    Flashed into crimson with the sunrise charm,
    So all my love, aroused to vague alarm,
Flushed into fire and burned with eager blaze.
I saw thee not as suppliant, with still gaze
    Of pleading, but as victor,--and thine arm
    Gathered me fast into embraces warm,
And I was taught the light of Love's dear ways.

This day of triumph is no longer thine,
    Oh conqueror, in calm exclusive power.--
As evermore, through storm, and shade, and shine,
      Your woe my pain, your joy my ecstasy,
    We breathe together,--so this blessed hour
      Of self-surrender makes my jubilee!




RONDEAU.--I WILL FORGET.


I will forget those days of mingled bliss
    And dear delicious pain,--will cast from me
    All dreams of what I know can never be,
Even the remembrance of that parting kiss.
I knew that some day it would come to this
    In spite of all our sworn fidelity,
    That I must banish even memory,
And, sorrowing, learn to say, nor say amiss
            I will forget.

I register this vow, and am content
    That it be so. Ah me!--yet, if the door
Shut on our heaven might be asunder rent
Even now, and I could see the way we went,
    I might retract my vow, and say no more
            I will forget.




RONDEAU.--WHEN SUMMER COMES.


When summer comes, and when o'er hill and lea
The sun's strong wooing glow hath patiently
  Shed o'er the earth long days his golden dower,
  And then, by force of his own loving power,
Drawn the hard frost, and left it passive, free
To give forth all its sweets untiringly,
Shall not the day rise fair for thee and me,
  And all life seem but as an opening flower
            When summer comes?

The days move slowly, young hearts yearn to be
Together always, cannot brook to see
  Their love-days pass, and void each sunny hour,
  Yet may we smile, e'en when fate's storm-clouds lower,
Waiting fulfilment of our hearts' decree
            When summer comes.




RONDEAU.--IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.


It might have been so different a year
  To what _has_ been; the summer's guileless play
  Not all a jest, comes back to me to-day
In added sweetness, and provokes a tear.
Strange pictures rise, pass on, and disappear.
  Drawn from your tender words of yesterday
  When, looking in my eyes in the old way
You told me of your life, how passing dear
    It might have been.

Useless to dream, more useless to regret!
  We might have lived and loved, nor lost the glow
Of Love's first sweet intensity;--to let
These foolish fancies die I strive,--and yet
  I still must count it happiness to know
    It might have been.




RONDEAU.--BROTHER AND FRIEND.


Brother and friend I found thee in the hour
  Of need and day of trouble, strong and true.--
  In June's fair mirth, and when the sunrise hue
Shewed bright where joy had built his thoughtless bower,
Thou wert a child to sport with, something lower
  Than a friend's need. I gave, methought, thy due,--
  An elder sister's gentleness, nor knew
That ere Spring dawned my soul would feel thy power.
    Brother and Friend!

A man, with a man's strength, and will, and fire,
  I know thee, my Alcides; thus a god
For some fair soul to reverence, and desire
To own and worship. _I_ can place thee higher
  To-day, in naming thee,--pain's paths just trod--
    Brother and Friend.




RONDEAU.--POURQUOI?


"Pourquoi," she breathed, then drooped her head,
(Pure snow-drifts to the sunset wed)
    As all my weakness I confessed.
    I shewed how I had done my best,
Though long ago I should have fled,
Knowing all hope, for me, was dead;
And now my heart would die, unfed.
    She murmured low, (was it in jest?)
            "Pourquoi?"

That winsome face, all rosy red,--
I turned towards me,--gone was dread!
    She came as birdlings to their nest
    At eventide; so was I blest
By that one precious, softly-said
            "Pourquoi?"




RONDEAU.--FOR OUR LOVE'S SAKE.


For our Love's sake I bid thee stay,
Sweet, ere the hours flee away,
    Beneath the old acacia tree
    That waves its blossoms quiveringly,
And think awhile of early May:

Of how the months have fled away,
And sunrise hour turned twilight gray,
    While we have suffered smilingly
          For our Love's sake.

It may not be--that which we pray
For tearfully--but dare not say.
    And yet if, Sweet, it may not be,
    We still may suffer silently,
Watching our sunlight fade away,
          For our Love's sake.




ECHOES.


A breath                |         A breath
    And a sigh,--       |             And a sigh,--
    How we fly          |             How we fly
From Death!             |         From Death!--
                        |
A palm                  |         Sing on
    Warm pressed,       |             O our bird!
    As we guessed       |             Thou art heard
Love's psalm.           |         Alone.
                        |
A word                  |         We know
    Breathed close,     |             No life,
    And then rose       |             Neither strife,
The bird                |         Nor woe,
                        |
That cowers             |         Nor aught
    In the wood         |             But this hour,--
    'Mid a flood        |             Love's dower
Of flowers,             |         Dear bought.--
                        |
Till Love's             |         Death's voice
    Heart sighs,        |             Is away,
    Like the cries      |             And we may
Of doves,--             |         Rejoice.
                        |
Then sings              |         The bird
    His song,           |             Of our song
    Beating strong      |             May be long
White wings,--          |         Unheard,
                        |
Heart clear             |         But, Dear,
    Though faint,       |             Bend low;
    Like a saint        |             It is now
In prayer.--            |         We hear.
                        |
He reigns               |         Dear Heart
    In power,           |             Your kiss!--
    And Love's hour     |             After this
Disdains.               |         We part.
                        |
Forget                  |         A breath
    For a day           |             And a sigh,--
    All his sway,       |             How we fly
Life's fret.            |         From Death!




NOON.


No ripple stirs the water,
    No song-bird wakes the grove,
Calm noon-tide sways his sceptre,
    And hushes even love.

On earth the sun-god bending
    Poureth his wondrous store;
The soft-tongued tide, advancing,
    Laps the unconscious shore.

The long, low isle of marsh-land
    Stretches in weary waste,
By sloping sand-banks guarded,
    By winding weeds embraced.

Comes clearly from the open
    The plash of distant oars,--
Over the rocky headland
    The snow-white sea-gull soars.

I see as if through dream-clouds,
    I hear from far away.
The scorched air breathes its opiate,
    The drowsy fancies stay;

I have no hopes or longings,
    I scarce can feel your kiss,--
For thought, and joy and worship,
    Another hour than this!




PICTURES.


The full-orbed Paschal moon; dark shadows flung
On the brown Lenten earth; tall spectral trees
Stand in their huge and naked strength erect,
And stretch wild arms towards the gleaming sky.
A motionless girl-figure, face upraised
In the strong moonlight, cold and passionless.

       *       *       *       *       *

A proud spring sunset; opal-tinted sky,
Save where the western purple, pale and faint
With longing for her fickle Love,--content
Had merged herself into his burning red.
A fair young maiden, clad in velvet robe
Of sombre green, stands in the golden glow,
One hand held up to shade her dazzled eyes,
A bunch of white Narcissus at her throat.

       *       *       *       *       *

November's day, dark, leaden, lowering,--
Grey purple shadows fading on the hills;
Dreary and desolate the far expanse
And gloomy sameness of the open plain.
A peasant woman, in white wimpled hood,
White vest, and scarlet petticoat, surveys
The meadow, with rough hands crossed on her breast.

       *       *       *       *       *

A shining, shimmering, gracious, golden day;
The sated summer's all-pervading hush;
Warm luscious tints, glowing in earth and sky.
On a low mossy bank, a little child,
His golden curls twined in the reedy grass,
Clutching within his tear-stained feverish hands
The yellow blossoms of the Celandine,
Sobs out his heart in passionate childish grief.




EURYDICE.


Oh come, Eurydice!
    The Stygian deeps are past
    Well-nigh; the light dawns fast.
Oh come, Eurydice!

The gods have heard my song!
    My love's despairing cry
    Filled hell with melody,--
And the gods heard my song.

I knew no life but thee;
    Persephone was moved;
    She, too, hath lived, hath loved;
She saw I lived for thee.

I may not look on thee,
    Such was the gods' decree;--
    Till sun and earth we see
No kiss, no smile for thee!

The way is rough, is hard;
    I cannot hear thy feet
    Swift following; speak, my Sweet,--
Is the way rough and hard?

"Oh come, Eurydice!"
    I turn: "our woe is o'er,
    I will not lose thee more!"
I cry: "Eurydice!"

O father Hermes, help!
    I see her fade away
    Back from the dawning ray;
Dear Father Hermes, help!

One swift look,--all is lost!
    Wild heaven-arousing cries
    Pierce to the dull dead skies;
My heaven, my all is lost!

The unrelenting gods
    Refuse me. "No," say they,
    "Thy chance is thrown away."
Fierce unrelenting gods!

The sky is blue no more,
    The spring-tide airs are bleak,
    I find not her I seek,
The earth is fair no more!

I loathe all earth, all life!
    These Thracian women gaze
    And whispering, go their ways,
Seeing I loathe my life.

Only my song remains.
    I may not cease to sing,
    Though hot tears start and sting,
The song that still remains,

Even--"Come Eurydice!"
    The sea rolls on in pain,
    Echoing the note again:
"Lost, lost Eurydice!"

And still the sea moves on,
    The woods give back the thrill
    "Eurydice!" and still
The quiet sea moves on.

The years, Eurydice,
    The long unquiet years
    Heed not or sighs or tears,
Oh Heart, Eurydice!




SLACK TIDE.


My boat is still in the reedy cove
Where the rushes hinder its onward course,
For I care not now if we rest or move
O'er the slumberous tide to the river's source.

My boat is fast in the tall dank weeds
And I lay my oars in silence by,
And lean, and draw the slippery reeds
Through my listless fingers carelessly.

The babbling froth of the surface foam
Clings close to the side of my moveless boat,
Like endless meshes of honeycomb,--
And I break it off, and send it afloat.

A faint wind stirs, and I drift along
Far down the stream to its utmost bound,
And the thick white foam-flakes gathering strong
Still cling, and follow, and fold around.

Oh! the weary green of the weedy waste,
The thickening scum of the frothy foam,
And the torpid heart by the reeds embraced
And shrouded and held in its cheerless home.

The fearful stillness of wearied calm,
The tired quiet of ended strife,
The echoed note of a heart's sad psalm,
The sighing end of a wasted life.--

The reeds cling close, and my cradle sways,
And the white gull dips in the waters' barm,
And the heart asleep in the twilight haze
Feels not its earth-bonds, knows not alarm.




AN EVENING IN OCTOBER


Evening has thrown her hushing garment round
This little world; no harsh or jarring sound
Disturbs my reverie. The room is dark,
And kneeling at the window I can mark
Each light and shadow of the scene below.
The placid glistening pools, the streams that flow
Through the red earth, left by the hurrying tide;
The ridge of mountain on the farther side
Shewing more black for many twinkling lights
That come and go about the gathering heights.
Below me lie great wharves, dreary and dim,
And lumber houses crowding close and grim
Like giant shadowed guardians of the port,
With towering chimneys outlined tall and swart
Against the silver pools. Two figures pace
The wharf in ghostly silence, face from face.
O'er the black line of mountain, silver-clear
In faint rose-tint of vaporous evening air,
Sinketh the bright suspicion of a wing,
The slim curved moon, who in shy triumphing
Hideth her face. Above, the rose-tint pales
Into a silver opal, hills and dales
Of cloudy glory, fading high alone
Into a tender blue-grey monotone.--
And then I thought: "ere that fair, slender moon
Has rounded grown and full, (so soon, so soon!)
Our hearts' desire accomplished we shall see
Dear one, all light, and joy, and ecstasy!"




PARTED.


My spirit holds you, Dear,
    Though worlds away,"--
This to their absent ones
    Many can say.

"Thoughts, fancies, hopes, desires,
    All must be yours;
Sweetest my memories still
    Of our past hours."

_I_ can say more than this
    Now, lover mine,--
Here can I feel your kiss
    Warmer than wine,

Feel your arms folding me,
    Know that quick breath
That aye my soul would stir
    Even in death.

'Tis not a memory, Love,
    Thoughts of the past,
Fleeting remembrances
    Which may not last,--

But, as I shut my eyes
    Know I the sign
That you are here, yourself,
    Bodily, mine.--

So, Love, I cannot say
    "My spirit flies
Over the widening space,
    Under dull skies,

To where _your_ spirit is,"--
    Though I may know
Seas part us, earth divides,
    It is not so

Here to me, now, for you
    Lean on my heart.
Who says that you and I
    Ever can part?--




TOUT POUR L'AMOUR.


The world may rage without,
    Quiet is here;
Statesmen may toil and shout,
    Cynics may sneer;
The great world,--let it go,--
June warmth be March's snow,
I care not,--be it so
    Since I am here.

Time was when war's alarm
    Called for a fear,
When sorrow's seeming harm
    Hastened a tear.
Naught care I now what foe
Threatens, for scarce I know
How the year's seasons go
    Since I am here.

This is my resting-place
    Holy and dear,
Where pain's dejected face
    May not appear;
This is the world to me,
Earth's woes I will not see,
But rest contentedly
    Since I am here.

Is't your voice chiding, Love,
    My mild career,
My meek abiding, Love,
    Daily so near?--
"Danger and loss," to me?
Ah, Sweet, I fear to see
No loss but loss of _thee_,
    And I am here.




SOOTHING.


I aimless wandered thro' the woods, and flung
My idle limbs upon a soft brown bank,
Where, thickly strewn, the worn-out russet leaves
Rustled a faint remonstrance at my tread.
The yellow fungi, shewing pallid stems,
The mossy lichen creeping o'er the stones
And making green the whitened hemlock-bark,
The dull wax of the woodland lily-bud,
On these my eye could rest, and I was still.
No sound was there save a low murmured cheep
From an ambitious nestling, and the slow
And oft-recurring plash of myriad waves
That spent their strength against the unheeding shore.
Over and through a spreading undergrowth
I saw the gleaming of the tranquil sea.
The woody scent of mosses and sweet ferns,
Mingled with the fresh brine, and came to me,
Bringing a laudanum to my ceaseless pain;
A quietness stole in upon me then,
And o'er my soul there passed a wave of peace.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
