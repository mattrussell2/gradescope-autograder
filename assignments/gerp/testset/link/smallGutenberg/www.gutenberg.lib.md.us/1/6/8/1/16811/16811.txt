Kamilaroi is the language spoken by the aborigines
along the Namoi River, on part of the Bundarra
and Balun, and 200 miles of the Barwan (or Darling);
also on Liverpool Plains, and about the head of the
Hunter.

The writer believes that any one who carefully
reads through this Key, _especially the first 2 pages_, will be
able to pronounce the foregoing Kamilaroi sentences,
and teach the aborigines to read them. Many of the
aborigines, especially the young men, are very quick at
learning to read.

It is very important that the rule of _naming_ the
letters according to their pronunciation in words should
be attended to, as it will remove great difficulties from
the way of beginners. How could an ignorant person
guess that the letter called "double you" had the sound
w in wit? or that "aitch" was merely a hard breathing?

The Christian into whose hands this little book may
come, and who has any aborigines speaking kamilaroi
near, is earnestly requested to consider, whether it is not
worth a patient and prayerful effort to teach them to
read those precious saving truths which are dimly and
scantily, but in some measure really, expressed in these
brief sentences.

KEY

To the foregoing "Kamilaroi speech."

RULES OF PRONUNCIATION.

Pronounce a as a in father
" a as a in mat
" e as ey in obey
" e as e in net
" i as i in marine
" i as i in it
" o as o in bone
" o as o in on
" u as oo in moon
" u as u in bun
" ai as i in wine
" ao as ow in how
" oi as oi in noise
" g always as in go
" ng as ng in ring.

In English we use the sound ng or ng only at the
end of a syllable; its frequent occurrence at the beginning
of a syllable in Kamilaroi is therefore a slight, but
only a slight difficulty. It is only necessary to use precisely
the same consonant sound which we have in ring,
sing, &#38;c., with a vowel after and not before it.

N.B. Name the letters as they are pronounced; that
is, call g _ge_ (as in get), h _he_, ng _eng_, r _re_, w _we_, and
y _ye_. Thus the name will guide the learner to the
proper sound in spelling.

The first four words on page 3 are names of men;
the next four words are names of women; then, as
follow, each line hereunder containing the English words
for the correspond line of Kamilaroi:--

sun, moon, earth, fire, pennyroyal (herb).
man, woman, boy, girl.
child, father, mother.
son, daughter.
brother, sister.

God verily sun, moon, stars, earth also made.

God always is good; God everything
sees, everything hears.

God verily every hill, plain, watercourse, tree,
grass, beran (a herb), pennyroyal made.

God verily horse, dog, kangaroo, opossum, goanna,
emu, native companion, cockatoo, swallow, pelican, parrot,
eagle, fish, brown-snake, deadly-black-snake, flies, mosquitoes, all
animals made.

God verily man made; first man Adam. God
said, "Not good man alone for to dwell; I
for man woman will make." Then God woman made; first
woman Eve; Eve wife of Adam.

Adam is father of the blackfellows, father of the whites, father of all:
Eve the mother of blacks, mother of whites, mother of all.

Adam, Eve also, astray went. All men
all women astray went, all bad became.
God angry became, he said "All men, all women,
astray are gone, all bad have become. I them dead
will smite." Immanuel, Son of God, said "Not so.
Not thou them smite; Thou me smite, I
will die; man, woman, alive for to be."

Immanuel with us God: he God man
became. Good is Immanuel; not another is good like him.

Long ago Immanuel to earth came, man he became.
He verily many sick well made, many blind
well made, many deaf well made.

A man
name Lazarus. Belonging to him two sisters Mary, Marta. Lazarus sick
became. The two sisters word sent to Immanuel, saying,
"My brother, Thy Lazarus, is sick." Not went Immanuel.
By and bye Lazarus died. Four days he lay dead
in the ground. Then Immanuel came. Mary, Martha also
were weeping.  Immanuel said "Your brother again alive
shall be." Many men, many women, were weeping. Immanuel
to the grave went; a stone the grave covered; Immanuel
said "Ye the stone take away." They the stone lifted up.
Immanuel cried aloud "Lazarus come forth." Then Lazarus
alive became, he came forth. The two sisters were very glad.

At another time a little girl sick became; the mother pennyroyal gave;
not the little girl well became; much she grew sick, almost
dead. The father went Immanuel to see; truly
he found him; he said "Thou quickly come, well make
my little girl. My little girl is very sick, almost dead;
you come to my house." Immanuel said
"We two will go to the House." Then went the two
to the house. The mother came, she wept, said "Alas! alas! my
little girl is dead." Many women were weeping, said "Alas!
the little girl is dead." Immanuel said "Cease weeping. Not
the girl is dead; only she is asleep." All of them laughed;
they verily her to-be-dead knew. Immanuel by hand took
the girl, said "damsel arise." Then the girl alive became,
arose, words spoke. The mother, father also, very glad.

Another time, two men blind sat by the way.
Immanuel there came; the two blind heard, they cried aloud,
"Immanuel, King, Son of David, look!
pity us." Many people said "Have done! cease
ye to cry aloud." The men blind again cried aloud
"King, Son of David, look! pity us!"

Then Immanuel stood still, said "What you will say? What
I shall do?" They said "King, grant
us to see." Then Immanuel them eyes touches;
instantly they are able to see.

Many bad men Immanuel seized. They
on his head thorns bound. They indeed a log laid, another
log across they laid: they indeed Immanuel laid down; hands
they pierced, feet they pierced; on cross fastened. They the cross
raised, Immanuel on the cross hanging. Soon Immanuel
died. Soon after a man with a spear his side pierced; blood flowed.

In evening they verily Immanuel in ground laid, covered.
Immanuel the night lay dead in ground; also one day he lay
dead in ground; also another night he lay dead
in ground; next morning alive he became, arose.
Soon after to heaven he went. Now Immanuel in heaven dwells; he
all sees, all knows.

Good is Immanuel; not another is good
like him. Hereafter Immanuel again to earth
will come; we all shall see. Immanuel aloud
will speak; then all the dead, men, women, children, all
alive shall become. Immanuel will say "What hast thou done?
What has thou done? thou good hast done? Thou
to me come to heaven. Thou evil hast done?
thou far go, very far go away."

Truly thou bad hast become; thou astry hast gone;
truly God angry is. God always is good;
we all astray have gone. Hearken; not
I lies tell; truth I tell. Immanuel from above
came down, from heaven to earth. All men bad are become;
Immanuel only is good; Immanuel died, men
alive for to be.

Now God saith: "Ye, all men,
cease bad to be, turn ye; we will be
reconciled. Not I angry am. Good Immanuel
died." Now Immanuel saith: "Come unto me
all ye weary, then I you will cause to rest."

You come to Immanuel.

A man dwelt
at Lystra; with sick foot diseased, very ill indeed;
not he could walk. Paul, Barnabas also there came. Paul
was speaking; the lame man him was hearing. Paul earnestly
looked, he cried aloud "stand upright on feet."
The lame man leapt, walked also.

All the people saw, they wondered, they cried aloud
"Gods two are come down like men." Paul, Barnabas
also ran, cired aloud "Have done! not we
gods; we men like you. We glad
become, we sorry become, we angry become, again we
are reconciled. We good tell to all;
cease ye any more evil to be; turn ye
look to God the living. God verily heaven, earth
the great water, all, everything made. God
always is God (the same ever.")

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
