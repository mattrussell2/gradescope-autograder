This is the root package directory for default implementations of summarizers, canonicalizers, etc. that can be overriden, supplemented, or in some cases subclassed by users.

The directory (subpackage) structure below this dir parallels what a user may supply in his/her testset definition directory, I.e. a summarizer package for summarizers, canonicalizer for canonicalizers, etc.
